⠀
## ~Last Speech in the Constituent Assembly~

### Intro:
1. The working of Constitution Does not depend wholly upon the nature of Constitution
2. However bad a constitution may be -> it may turn good if those who are called to work it happen to be good
3. However good a constitution may be -> it may turn bad if those who are called to work it happen to be bad
4. Constitution just provide organs of Executive, Legislative and Judiciary and working of these organs completely depend on People
5. The Constitution fails the moment people prefer revolutionary methods for Achieving their purposes.

⠀
#### Ambedkar emphasised " Constitution should not be binding succeeding Generations"
1. Ambedkar did not say Parliamentary democracy is the only form of ideal  political democracy
2. Principles embodied in the constitution are views of present (constituent assembly) generation.
3. He emphasised what Jefferson (American Statesman who played prominent role in making American Constitution) said -> " We may consider each generation as a distinct nation, with a right by the will of the majority, to bind themselves, but none to bind the succeeding generation more than the inhabitants of another country(succeeding generation)"

⠀
#### Ambedkar emphasised " The Danger of Divisive Politics"
1. Ambedkar worried -> India used to have Independence once but lost it, will it lose it again?
2. He mostly worried that -> India had lost its Freedom once because of infidelity and treachery of some of her own people.
   1. Sind invasion -> by Mohammad Bin Kasim -> commanders of King Dhar accepted bribes
   2. Mohammad Ghori -> invited by Jai Chand -> to invade India and Fight Against Prithvi Raj
   3. Shivaji fighting for liberation of Hindus -> other Maratha Nobel Men and Rajputs -> fighting alongside Mughals
   4. British -> trying to destroy Sikhs -> Gulab Singh and his commanders sat silent 
   5. In 1857 -> A war of Independence against British -> Sikhs stood and watched the Event as Silent Spectators 
   6. He is anxious that along with Caste and Creed in the newly Independent India we would have many political parties with diverse and opposing political creeds
   7. If one places creed above the country, our independence will be put in jeopardy a second time and probably be lost forever. 

⠀
#### Ambedkar words on Political Democracy and Equality in Social and Economic Life:
*"On the 26th of January 1950 we are going to enter a life of contradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality. In politics we will be recognising the principle of one man, one vote and one vote one value. In our Social and Economic life, we shall by reason of our Social and Economic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting out political democracy in peril"* - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

#### Ambedkar about the importance of Constitutional Methods:
1. He was anxious that long disuse of democracy and suddenly coming to light -> might give place to dictatorship
2. He wished to maintain democracy not merely in form but also in fact
3. This meant -> we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution -> civil disobedience, non-cooperation and satyagraha
4. When there's no way of constitutional methods for achieving social and economic objectives -> it is justified for unconstitutional methods
5. But when there's a constitutional method available -> all the unconstitutional methods are not justified and should be abandoned.

⠀
*"If i find the Constitution being misused I shall be the first to burn it"* - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

#### Ambedkar on Politics of Pedestals:
1. He emphasised -> "There's nothing wrong in being grateful to great men but there are limits to gratefulness"
2. Recalled what Irish Patriot Danniel O'Connel said 

*⠀"No man can be grateful at the cost of his honour, no woman can be grateful at cost of her chastity, and no Nation can be Grateful at cost of its liberty"*
3. He said -> Bhakti and Hero-worship play a big part in our Politics, more than any politics in World

⠀*"Bhakti in religion may be a road to the salvation of the soul, but in politics, Bhakti or hero worship is a sure road to degradation and eventual dictatorship." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

"indIfferentism is the worst kind of disease that can effect people" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

#### Ambedkar about Social Democracy:
1. He emphasised we must not content with mere Political democracy but also make our Political Democracy a Social Democracy
2. In his opinion Social Democracy is a way of life which recognises liberty, equality and fraternity as the principles of life.
3. He said that these Principles of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are not to be treated as separate items but they form a Union of Trinity
   1 Without Equality -> liberty would produce supremacy of few over many
   2 Without Liberty -> Equality would kill individual initiatives 
   3 Without Fraternity -> Equality and Liberty could not become a natural course of things
4. According to him, India is lacking social and economic equality, after Republic we will have political equality but there will be lacking in social and economic equality, if this situation persisted for long we would be putting our democracy in peril
5. He opined fraternity means a sense of common brotherhood of all Indians, Indians being one people. It is the principle which gives unity and solidarity to social life, It is a difficult thing to achieve.

⠀
#### Ambedkar on Building a Nation:
1. He has a Opinion whether we are a Nation, he felt we are cherishing a great delusion
2. He argued how can people divided into several thousands of castes be a nation
3. He felt the sooner we realise that we are not a nation in social and psychological sense of word, the better for us
4. For then only we aspire towards the necessity of becoming a Nation.
5. He felt Castes are anti-national in the first place as they bring about separation in social life, also they are anti nationals because they generate jealousy and antipathy between caste and caste.
6. We must overcome all these difficulties if we wish to become a nation in reality. For fraternity can be fact only when there is a nation. Without fraternity, equality and liberty will no deeper than coats of paint. 
7. He said for many years the political power has been the monopoly of few and they deprived the down-trodden classes of their chance of betterment
8. And this creates impatience among down-trodden classes and they get get tired of being governed and also being governed themselves -> which turn into class struggle
9. Emphasises what Abraham Lincoln Said "A House divided itself cannot stand very long"
10. Therefore there has to be room for the realisation of betterment of the down-trodden classes
11. Which would be better for the democracy and independence of Country
12. This done by the establishment of equality and fraternity

⠀
*" Equality may be a fiction, but nonetheless one must accept it as a governing principle" - Dr. B. R Ambedkar*

## **Analysis from the Speech of Anihilation of Caste:**
#### Intro: 
The Speech to be delivered at the Annual Conference of the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal at Lahore in 1936 -> but the Conference got cancelled and speech never delivered

### Ambedkar Perspective on Speech:
1 All he hoped to do is place before them his views on problems and left the people to judge him

⠀
#### Part 1:
1. He hoped for a Social Reformer to be given the importance
2. He felt the politics is being too extreme such that it even discarded the importance of social reform
3. He pointed out the Balais Situation of following the conditions of Upper Caste so that they can live among them, also he pointed out various other issues where using ghee and using metal pots by untouchables seen as impudence by Hindus
4. He specified if one accept that one country is not fit to rule other they must also accept one class should not rule another class which the congressman accepted as dogma of mill
5. He felt the main reason The Social Reform Party was lost mainly because they only felt of reform of the Hindu Family which deal with evils of Child Marriage, Enforced Widowhood etc.. whereas they felt no necessity or had not the courage for agitating for the abolition of Caste which alter the Hindu Society and bring Social reform
6. He called for makers of Political Constitutions to take account of social forces, which recognised by Ferdinand Lassalle - "The Constitutional Questions are in the first instance not questions of right, but questions of might. The actual constitution of a country has its existence only in the actual condition of force which exists in the country: hence political constitutions have value and permanence only when they accurately express those conditions of forces which exist in practice within a society"
7. He emphasised one cannot think of making Constitution without addressing the social problems, for this he gave examples of Ulster Irish Home Rule, Roman Republic
8. He said history itself bears out the proposition that political revolutions have always been preceded by social and religious revolutions
   1 Religious reform -> Luther -> precursor of Political emancipation of the European People in England.
   2 Puritanism and American War of Independence 
   3 Islam and Arab Political Power
   4 Buddha and Chandragupta political revolution
   5 Shivaji and saints of Maharastra
9. He finally said emancipation of the mind and the soul is a necessary preliminary for the political expansion of the people.

⠀
#### Part 2:
1. Ambedkar said that Socialist with their belief of man being economic creature, preach that political and social reforms are but gigantic illusions and that economic reform by equalisation of property must have precedence over every other kind of reform.
2. Against the ideology of Socialists, he argued that religion is the source of power is illustrated by the history of India where the priest holds a sway over the common man often greater than the magistrate
3. Religion, Social Status and property are all sources of power and Authority, which one man has, to control the liberty of another (one is predominant than other depending upon the stage)
4. If Liberty is the ideal, though which the destruction of the dominion of which one man holds over another then
5. Obviously the reform cannot be insisted on only economy, where there is dominion of social and religious there has be Social and Religious Reform necessarily 
6. He emphasised that even some socialists said that they do not believe that they can build a free society in India so long as there is a trace of this ill-treatment and suppression of one class by another
7. He said if Socialists wish to make socialism a definite reality, then they must recognise that the problem of social reform is fundamental, and that for them there is no escape from it.
8. That the social order is prevalent in India is a matter which a Socialist must deal with, that unless he does so he cannot achieve his revolution, even if he does achieve it with good fortune he has to grapple with it if he wishes to realise his ideal
9. He just said that turn in any direction you like, caste is the monster that crosses your path, you cannot have political reform, you cannot have economic reform, unless you kill this monster.

⠀
#### Part 3:
1. He felt pity that even today caste has defenders on the ground that the caste system is but another name for division of labour
2. He said Caste System is not merely a division of labour but division of labourers where there is presence of gradation along with confining their choice of occupation into water tight compartments
3. He said caste is doing nothing but curtailing the individual choice of a human solely based on dogma of predestination
4. He said because of the Hindu religious caste system -> there has been aversion towards some occupations and this is the main reason for low efficiency of industrial system 
5. He said "As and Economic organisation, caste is therefore a harmful institution, inasmuch as it involves the subordination of man's natural powers and inclinations to the exigencies of social rules".

⠀
#### Part 4:
1. He argued that some have dug a biological trench in defence of the caste system was to preserve purity of race and purity of blood
2. For this he gave his saying that "ethnologists are of opinion that men of pure race exist nowhere and that there has been mixture of all races"
3. He backed his saying by mentioning DR Bhandarkar, where in his paper "Foreign Elements in Hindu Population" mentioned that there is hardly a class, or caste in India which has not a foreign strain"
4. He also mentioned caste system came into being long after the different races of India had commingled in blood and culture. 

⠀(**MY Personal Point**: What's wrong in commingling and what's benefit in maintaining a pure race, you might give reasons like social security, but nature works in such a way that it don't know what caste is or know some social order you are keeping, Nature is unpredictable and it works according to the laws of Nature, and it would be our Human failure to go against the will of Nature, mainly we become inhuman by curtailing the will of Human Mind by restricting him to some social norms)

5. He argued with the ones who said Caste is racial demarcation, by saying that what's racial affinity is there between Brahmin of Punjab and Brahmin of Tamil Nadu, in fact brahmin of Tamil Nadu is more racially similar to Dalit of Tamil Nadu and the case is same for Punjab

⠀(**My personal Point**: Why even needed the Demarcation, isn't the feeling of humanism or at most Nationalism enough to maintain the sense of oneness)

6. He argued if Caste is eugenic in nature, then Sub-castes are also eugenic where the race is being divided, this itself indicates the prohibition of intermarrying, but the act of prohibiting interdining goes beyond the act of eugenic
7. This shows that caste system does not embody the eugenics of modern scientists, it is a social system which embodies the arrogance and selfishness of a perverse section of the Hindus who were superior enough in social status to set it in fashion and who had authority to force it on their inferiors.

⠀
#### Part 5:
1. Caste has completely disorganised and demoralised Hindus
2. He argued the Name Hindu is not in any Sanskrit scripture prior to Mohammedan Invasion, the word itself is a foreign name
3. Hindu society as such does not exist, Hindu society is just a collection of castes
4. Where Castes are too much conscious of their existence, castes do not form a federation, a caste has no feeling that it is associated with other castes.
5. Ideal Hindu must be like a rat living in his own hole refusing to have any contact with others.
6. He considered what sociologists call Consciousness of Kind where he said, in Hindus there's nothing but consciousness of Caste.
7. Making the individual a sharer or partner in the associated activity so that he feels its success as his success, its failure as his failure is the real thing that binds men and makes a society of them, The Caste System prevents common activity , it has prevented the Hindus from becoming a society with a unified life and a consciousness of its own being. 

⠀
#### Part 6:
1. The Anti-Social spirit is the worst feature of their own caste system
2. This Anti-social spirit is not confined to caste alone. It has gone deeper and has poisoned the mutual relations of the sub castes as well
3. Anti-Social spirit between Sub Castes of Brahmins is as virulent as anti-social spirit between Brahmin and Non-brahmin
4. He said, Hindus, therefore are not merely an assortment of castes, but they are so many warring groups, each living for itself and for its selfish idea
5. Another feature of Caste which is deplorable is, the existence of caste and caste consciousness has served to keep the memory of past feuds between castes and has prevented solidarity

⠀
#### Part 7:
1. He said aboriginals remain savage for 1000s of years though being in a civilised country 
2. Because of the caste, Hindu has let the savage remain a savage in the midst of his civilization, without blushing or without feeling any sense of remorse or repentance
3. He said Hindus did not realise that these so called savages would be danger
4 .If they are reclaimed by Non-Hindus and converted to their faiths, they will swell the ranks of enemies of the Hindus.

⠀
*"Religion, Social Status, and property are all sources of power and authority which one man has, to control the liberty of another" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Part 8:
1. He said Brahminical Hindus were against others castes getting knowledge from them and wanted to rise to the cultural level of higher castes
2. He gave examples of Sonars and Pathare Prabhu in Maharastra
3. Mohammedans and Christians, cut down the throats of unwilling persons, which they regarded necessary for their salvation
4. But Hindu would not spread the light, who would endeavour to keep others in darkness, who would not consent to share his intellectual and social inheritance with those who are ready and willing to make it a part of their own make-up.
5. He said he had no hesitation in saying that "If Mohammedan has been cruel, the Hindu has been mean, and meanness is worse than cruelty.

⠀
#### Part 9:
1. Next Ambedkar gave his reasoning on why Hindu religion ceased to be a missionary religion
2. He said this is due to castes, Castes are autonomous and there is no authority anywhere to compel a caste to admit a new comer to its social life. 
3. Hindu society being a collection of castes and each caste is being a close corporation, there is no place for a convert
4. Thus it is the caste which has prevented the Hindus from expanding and from absorbing other religious communities
5. So as long as castes remain, Hindu religion cannot be made a missionary religion and Shuddhi will be both a folly and futility.

⠀
#### Part 10:
1. The reasons which have made Shuddhi impossible for Hindu also responsible for making Sangathan impossible
2. The idea underlying Sangathan -> remove from the mind of Hindu that timidity and cowardice
3. These qualities set him apart from Mohammedan and Sikh, which led him to low ways of treachery and cunning for protecting himself
4. Mohammedan and Sikh -> derive this strength that all fellow Mohammedans and fellow Sikhs would come to rescue if he is attacked.
5. The Hindu can derive no such strength.
6. Among Sikhs and Muslims, there is a social cement which makes them bhais or brothers. Among Hindus there is no such cement, and one Hindu does not regard another Hindu as his bhai. 
7. So long as caste remains there will be no Sangathan and so long as there is no Sangathan the Hindu will remain weak and meek
8. Indifferentism is the worst disease that can infect people, and why Hindu so indifferent -> in the opinion of Ambedkar indifferentism is the result of caste system which has made co-operation even for a good cause, impossible.

⠀
#### Part 11:
1. A caste has unquestioned right to excommunicate any man who is guilty of breaking the rules of caste, when it is realised that excommunication involves a complete cesser of social intercourse
2. He said therefore no wonder, Individual hindus have not had the courage to assert their independence by breaking the barriers of caste
3. It is true that a man cannot get on with his fellows, but it is also true that he cannot do without them, if he cannot get it on his terms, then he will be ready to have it on any terms even amounting to complete surrender
4. Therefore Caste can easily organise itself into a conspiracy to make the life of a reformer a hell
5. Caste in the hands of the orthodox has been a powerful weapon for persecuting the reforms and for killing all reform.

⠀
#### Part 12:
1. He said the effect of caste on Ethics of  Hindus is deplorable
2. Caste has killed public spirit
3. Caste has destroyed the sense of public charity
4. Caste made public opinion impossible, A Hindus public is his caste, his responsibility is his caste only
5. Sympathy, charity and any such social welfare aspect starts and ends within caste itself
6. Caste doesn't make them acknowledge the greatness of people from other caste
7. Caste make them to follow the immoral ways, just to protect the feeling of Caste.

⠀
#### Part 13:
1. For him the ideal would be the Society based on Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.
2. He believed an Ideal society  should be mobile, should be full of channels for conveying a change to take place in one part to other parts.
3. He said in a free society there should be varied and free points of contact with other modes of association -> which he told to be Social Endosmosis
4. The above is his idea of Fraternity which is another name for Democracy -> which is not merely a form of Government, it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience.
5. He questions any objectivity to Liberty -> as why not allow liberty to benefit by an effective and competent use of person's powers
6. He questions any objectivity to Equality -> saying Equality in treatment regardless of physical heredity and social endowment would avoid the selection of privilege and promote the selection of able in the race and also feasible to have rough and ready rule to treat all men equal because classification and assortment is impossible.

⠀*"The doctrine of equality is glaringly fallacious but  taking all in all it is the only way a statesman can proceed in politics which is severely practical affair and which demands a severely practical test"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Part 14:
1. He criticised the Arya Samajists using the labels of Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra and mentioning the division is not on Birth and but on worth
2. He said the usage of such labels in the first place is a wrong thing to do

⠀
#### Part 15:
1. He pointed out the difficulties of incorporating Chaturvaranya which is based on the worth
2. 1st Difficulty -> one need to breakdown the mindset of caste from minds of people and compel them to take status according to worth not birth
3. 2nd Difficulty ->  
   1. for this he pointed that Modern Science has shown that lumping together of individuals into a few sharply marked-off classes is a superficial view of man not worthy of serious consideration, 
   2. also gave the example of failure of Platos Republic dividing people into three categories, 
   3. as the utilisation of the qualities of individuals is incompatible with their stratification by classes, since qualities of individuals are so variable. 
   4. And it is impossible to accurately classify people in to four definite classes when these four original classes become 4000 castes

⠀(**My opinion**: Why to divide in the first place? -> Aren't we all belong to a single class called humans? And the Character of Human changes every day it doesn’t even remain constant to Label it. So why one should divide more and what's benefit of it?)

4. Third Difficulty -> This would be maintaining Chatur Varna according to Law and including women into it

⠀
#### Part 16:
1. He questioned why the mass of people tolerated the social evils to which they have been subjected to 
2. For this he gave an answer that Lower Classes of Hindus have been completely disabled for direct action on the account of this wretched system of chaturvaranya
3. He criticised that the Chaturvaranya system made Shudra to be inaccessible to 
   1. Arms as Kshatriyas did not allow them to
   2. Education as Brahmins did not allow them to
   3. Politics as Vaishyas did not allow them to 
4. Where as these are the three weapons for emancipation that made the Europe to wage a Social War which is raging more violently than in India
5. Pointed that period of Maurya Empire is the only period which is period of freedom, greatness and glory, said in this period Chaturvarnya was completely annihilated, when Shudras started to become rulers of the countyr

⠀
#### Part 17:
1. he questioned the credibility of Chatur Varna -> as it is inflicting the animosity between Varna members at first place.
2. He gave an example of  -> Bhagwat where it tells Krishna taken avatar for the purpose to annihilate Kshatriyas

⠀
#### Part 18:
1. He gave his reply to the ones who questioned that non-Hindus also has caste and what's wrong in Hindus Having Caste
2. For that question -> He gave 3 differences of How Castes perceived between Hindus and Non-Hindus
   1. Reason 1:
      1. If a Hindu asks Non-Hindu his identity and Non-Hindu replies with the religion -> then that Hindu is satisfied
      2. But while coming to asking a Hindu, the one who asks is not satisfied with the religious identity but also wants Caste identity
      3. This indicates there is no integrating force among the Hindus to counteract the disintegration caused by Caste
      4. Whereas caste has no significance between Non-Hindus as it is significant between Hindus
   2. Reason 2:
      1. A Sikh or Mohammedan will not outcaste someone if he broke his caste
      2. But in Hindus he is sure to be outcasted if he broke caste
      3. This shows difference between social significance of caste between Hindus and Non-Hindus
   3. Reason 3 (Most Important):
      1. Caste among Non-Hindus has no religious consecration, but among Hindus it has
      2. Non-Hindus -> treat caste is only practice and not a sacred institution, They did not got any religious origination, and they don't regard Caste a Religious Dogma
      3. Whereas in Hinduism Religion itself compels the Hindus to treat isolation and segregation of castes as Virtue
      4. Therefore its a mere delusion to take comfort in ones Caste in Hindus, without knowing what is the significance of Caste in Non-Hindus
      5. And for those who argued that Hinduism lasted since the beginning of Civilisation, for those he answered that it not how long it lasted, instead the way it lasted, he said once a Hindu realises the way it lasted for so long makes him feel nothing but Shame.

⠀
#### Part 19:
1. He expressed there should be change in Social order for for one to achieve little by way of progress

⠀
*"In my opinion, that unless you change your social order, you can achieve little by way of progress " - Dr B. R Ambedkar*

*"You cannot mobilise the community either for defence or for offence. You cannot build anything on the foundations of caste. You cannot build up a nation, you cannot build any morality. Anything that you will build on the foundations  of caste will crack and will never be a whole" - Dr B. R. Ambedkar*

2. For how to bring reform and how to abolish caste he went on describing multiple ways
3. First supposition is to abolish sub-castes, as there lot of similarity between sub-castes, for this he showed that Brahmins of North are completely different from the Brahmins of South
4. also this could lead the reform to be stopped with abolition of sub-castes and in such a way abolition of subcastes will only make castes more powerful
5. He also considered supposition of inter-dining, but it is a common experience that inter-dining has not succeeded in killing the spirit of cast and consciousness of caste
6. But ultimately he believed that the real remedy is inter-marriage, as Fusion of blood alone create the feeling of being kith and kin.

⠀
*"Unless this feeling of kinship, of being kindred, becomes paramount the separatist feeling - the feeling of being aliens as created by caste will not vanish" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"The real remedy for breaking caste is inter-marriage. Nothing else will serve as the solvent of caste"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

7. He congratulated the Jat-Pat-Todak Mandal in direct frontal attack where they stood for inter-dining and inter-marriages of caste

⠀
*"Political Tyranny is nothing compared to social tyranny and a reformer who defies society, is a much more courageous man than a politician, who defies the government" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

8. Even though they are addressing the issue, he questioned why there cause is not popular, for that he said that inter-dining and inter-marriage are repugnant to the beliefs and dogmas which Hindus regard as sacred

⠀
*"Caste is not a physical object like a wall of bricks or a line of barbed wire which prevents the Hindus from co-mingling and which has, therefore, to be pulled down. Caste is a notion, it is a state of mind. The destruction of caste does not therefore mean the destruction of physical barrier. It means a notional change" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

9. He said the problem not lies with People showing discrimination, but the problem lies with the thing that make people show discrimination, which is nothing but Religion and religious beliefs.

⠀
*"It must be recognised that Hindus observe caste not because they are inhuman or wrong headed. They observe caste because they are deeply religious." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"The acts of people are merely the results of their beliefs inculcated upon their minds by shaastras and that people will not change their conduct until they cease to believe in the sanctity of the shaastras on which their conduct is founded" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"To agitate for and to organise inter-caste dinners and inter-caste marriages is like forced feeding brought about by artificial means. Make every man and woman free from thraldom of the shaastras, cleanse their minds of the pernicious notions founded on the shaastras, and he or she will inter-dine and inter-marry, without your telling him or her to do so"*
*-  Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

10. The way shaastras are being understood by the people is what creating the problem

⠀
*"You must take the stand that Buddha took. You must take the stand which Guru Nanak took. You must not only discard the shaastras, you must deny their authority, as did Buddha and Nanak. You must have the courage to tell the Hindus, that what is wrong with them is their religion - the religion which has produced in them this notion of the sacredness of caste. Will you show that courage?"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*


#### Part 20:
1. According to him there are three kinds of social reforms
   1. Reform which is secular do nothing with Religion
   2. The reform which accords with the principles of religion 
   3. The reform which not only touches the religious principles but is diametrically opposed to those principles
2. Caste is the natural outcome of certain religious beliefs which have the sanction of Shaastras
3. The destruction of Caste falls under the third Category
4. To ask people to give up caste is to ask them to go contrary to their fundamental religious notions
5. The third category is a stupendous task, one must destroy the sacredness and divinity with which caste has become invested, one must destroy the authority of Shaastras and Vedas
6. For ones this task is a herculean, One alone can say whether he is capable of achieving it
7. For him, he see the task to be well near impossible
8. And the reasons he gave are:
   1. Attitude of hostility, which the Brahmins have shown towards this question
   2. As brahmins can be seen standing for political reform also for economic reform
   3. They aren't seen in even as camp followers in the army to break down the barricades of caste
   4. For him there's no hope, even some might argue there would be some secular Brahmins, he expects Brahmins would never lead such social movement because break up of caste system is bound to affect adversely the Brahmin Caste.
   5. In his judgement, it is useless to make a distinction between the secular brahmins and priestly Brahmins
   6. A man who is born a Brahmin has much less desire to become a revolutionary
   7. For this re-called remarks made by Prof Dicey while speaking of the actual limitation on the legislative supremacy of the parliament:

⠀*"The actual exercise of authority by any sovereign whatever, and notably by Parliament, is bounded or controlled by two limitations. Of these the one is an external, and the other is an internal limitation. The External limit to the real power of the sovereign consists in the possibility or certainty that his subjects or a large number of  them will disobey or resist laws.. The internal limit to the exercise of sovereignty arises from the nature of the sovereign power itself."*

*"Even a despot exercises his powers in accordance with his Character, which itself moulded by the circumstance under which he lives, including that head the moral feelings of the tie and the society to which he belongs"*

*"People sometimes ask the idle question, why the pope does not introduce this or that reform? The true answer is that a revolutionist is not the kind of man who becomes a Pope and that man who becomes a Pope has no wish to be a revolutionist"*
*- Dicey*

8. For the Question why do Brahmins even needed for Social Reform, he replied that
   1. In every country the intellectual class is the most influential class, if not governing class
   2. It is the class which can advise and give lead

⠀*"There's no exaggeration in saying that the entire destiny of a country depends upon its intellectual class. If intellectual class is honest, independent and disinterested, it can be trusted to take the initiative and give a proper lead when a crisis arises."*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"It is true that intellect by itself is no virtue. It is only a means and the use of means depends upon the ends which an intellectual person pursues. As intellectual man can be a good man but he can easily be a rogue"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"An intellectual class may be a band of high-souled persons, ready to help, ready to emancipate erring humanity, or it may easily be a gang of crooks or a body of advocates of narrow clique from which it draws its support"  - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

9. In India Intellectual class is simply an another name for Brahmin caste, which has regarded itself the custodian of the interest of that caste, rather than the interests of the country
10. Also he claimed its a caste which is held great reverence by the rest of the Hindus, where the Hindus are taught brahmins are Bhudevas, and taught Brahmins alone can be their teachers. 
11. He also gave the proof that this is being explained by Manu
12. So he argues that if such an intellectual class is opposed to the reform of caste, the chances of success in a movement for the break-up of the caste system appear to be very very remote
13. Further reasons for Caste being broken is an impossible task is that
    1. Caste divides men into separate communities, and it places these communities in a graded order one above the other in Social Status
    2. Each caste takes pride in its position of being above of some other caste, also the outward mark of this gradation, there is also a gradation of Social and religious rights 
    3. This gradation, this scaling of castes, makes it impossible to organise a common front against the caste system
    4. Also he emphasised the vanity of Karl Marx's slogan "You have nothing to lose except your chains", this is used by Karl Marx to excite proletariat for economic revolution.
    5. As in Caste System everyone are slaves which are not equal in status.

⠀*"Castes form a graded system of sovereignties, high and low, which are jealous of their status and which know that if a general dissolution came, some of them stand to lose more of their prestige and power than others do. You cannot, therefore, have a general mobilisation of the Hindus, to use a military expression, for an attack on the caste system" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"Nothing is infallible. Nothing is binding forever. Everything is subject to inquiry and examination"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*


#### Part 21;
1. He quoted the writings of Manu, that Hindus might not be free to follow his reason,

⠀*"Vedah Smrith Sadacharah uvasy chapriyamatmanab" -> Here there is no place for reason to play its part,  A Hindu must follow either Veda, Smriti or Sadahar. He cannot follow any text - Manu*

2. He also expressed the reply of Manu on how to interpret texts of Vedas and Smritis, it any doubt arises regarding their meaning

*"Yovamanyet te moole hetushrashraya dwizah*
⠀*Sa sadhubhirbahishkaryo nashtiko vedandikah"*
*- Manu*

3. According to the above statement, where a matter covered by Vedas and Smritis on which they have given positive injunction and have conflict, the solution is not left to reason,
4. but both are to be regarded as of equal authority and either of them may be followed which made clear through -> "*Shrutidwadham tu yatraa syaptatra dharvarvudhau smritau" - Manu*
5. When there is a conflict between Shruti and Smriti, the Shruti must prevail, here too, no attempt must be made to find out which of the two accords with reason -> this laid down by Manu in:

*⠀" Ya vedabahyah snrityo yashch kashch kridrishtah*
  *Sarvasta nishphalah prety tamonishtha hi tah smritah"*  - Manu

6. He gave two other slokas one from Brihaspati and other from Mahabharat which tells that a Hindu should avoid reason at any cost while following Vedas and Smritis

⠀
*"Reason and Morality are the two most powerful weapons in the armoury of a reformer. To deprive him of the use of these weapons is to disable him for action" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"How are you going to break up caste, if people are not free to consider whether it accords with reason? How are you going to break up caste if people are not free to consider whether it accords with morality?"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

7. He said Brahmins are fighting as army for the defending caste, and this is why he said breaking up caste among Hindus is well-nigh impossible
8. He said it would take ages before a breach is made, and destroy the part of Vedas and Shaastras, which deny any part of morality and which deny any part to reason, and should destroy the religion of the Shrutis and Smritis.
9. Railway Journeys and foreign travels are really occasions of crisis in the life of a Hindu and it is natural to expect Hindu to ask himself why he should maintain caste at all, if he cannot maintain it all times. But he does not.
10. He breaks caste at one step and proceeds to observe it at the next, without raising any question. The reason for this is found in shaastras which directs him to maintain caste as far as possible and to undergo prayaschitta when he cannot

⠀
*"By this theory of Prayaschitta, the shaastras by following a spirit of compromise have given caste a perpetual lease of life and have smothered reflective thought which would have otherwise led to destruction of notion of caste"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

11. He emphasised that there have been many who have worked in the cause of the abolition of caste and untouchability. Of those who can be mentioned, Ramanuja, Kabir and others stand out prominently. Can one appeal to the acts of these reformers and exhort Hindus to follow them?
12. Ambedkar pointed that even Manu emphasised about Sadachar, and his view on following Sadachar no matter what, but at the same time Manu here did not mean Sadachar is being righteous instead it is following the customs

⠀
#### Part 22;
1. According to him
   1. Rules are -> practical, they are habitual ways of doing things according to prescription
   2. The rule may be right but the act may be mechanical
   3. Principles are intellectual, they are useful methods of judging things.
   4. The principle may be wrong, but the act is conscious and responsible
2. The religious act may not be a correct act, but must at least be a responsible act
3. To permit this responsibility, religion must be a matter of principles only. It cannot be a matter of rules
4. The moment it degenerates into rules, it ceases to be religion, as it kills the responsibility which is essence of a truly religious act.

⠀
*"To put it in plain language, what the Hindus call religion is really law, or at best, legalised class-ethics. Frankly, I refuse to cull this code of ordinances, as religion." - Dr. B. R Ambedkar*

*"The first evil of such a code of ordinances, misrepresented to the people as religion, is that it tends to deprive moral life of freedom and spontaneity and to reduce it to a more or less anxious and servile conformity to externally imposed rules" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"But the worst evil of this code of ordinances is that the laws it contains must be the same yesterday, today and forever" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"The objectionable part of such a scheme is not that they are made by certain persons called prophets or law-givers. The objectionable part is that this code has been invested with the character of finality and fixity" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"I have therefore, no hesitation in saying that such a religion must be destroyed and I say, there is nothing irreligious in working for the destruction of  such a religion." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"Indeed i hold that it is your bounden duty to tear the mask, to remove the misrepresentation that is caused by misnaming this law as religion. This is essential step for you. Once you clear the minds of the people of this misconception and enable them to realise that what they  are told is not religion, but that it is really law, you will be in a position to urge for its amendment or abolition" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Part 23:
1. Though he condemned a religion of rules on contrary he agrees that religion is the foundation of society, for this he also recalled

⠀
*"True religion is the foundation of society, the basis on which all true civil government rests, and both their sanction" - Burke*   

2. While suggesting to annul the ancient rules, he at the same time suggested its place shall be taken by religion of principles
3. For this religion reform, the necessary items he regarded are -> 
   1. There should be one and only one standard book of Hindu religion, acceptable to all Hindus and  recognized by all Hindus
   2. Priesthood among Hindus must be abolished or at least cease to be hereditary, every person who professes to be a Hindu must be eligible for being a priest. It should be provided by law that no Hindu shall be entitled to be a priest unless he has passed an examination prescribed by the state and holds a sanad(certificate) from the state permitting him to practice.
   3. No ceremony performed by a priest who does not hold a sanad, and such shall be deemed to be valid in law and it should be made penal for a person who has no sanad to officiate as a preist
   4. A priest should be servant of the state and should be subject to the disciplinary action by the state un the matter of his morals, beliefs, worship, in addition to his being subject along with other citizens to the ordinary law of land
   5. The number of priest should be limited by law according to the requirements of the state as is done in the case of ICS
4. According to him this is not radical because, every profession in India is regulated everyone should show proficiency before they are allowed to practice their professions
5. Such a way priests obey not only law of land but also special code of morals prescribed by their respective professions
6. But in reality priest is the only profession which is not subject to any code, no matter what's the character of priest is 
7. All this become possible because for a priest it is enough to be born in priestly caste
8. He suggested that priestly class must be brought under control by some such legislation as he has outlined such that there will be prevention of mischief from misguiding people
9. Such a way there will be democratisation in Priestly Class which will kill Brahminism and certainly will kill Caste
10. According to him Brahminism is the poison which has spoiled Hinduism, one will succeed in saving Hinduism if one kills Brahminism
11. He suggested to have a religion whose doctrinal basis is Liberty, Equality and Fraternity

⠀
*"You must give a new doctrinal basis to your religion - a basis that will be in consonance with Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, in short with Democracy" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Part 24:
1. He then lastly goes on to ask Hindus some vital Questions
2. Whether it is sufficient to take the placid view of anthropologist that there is nothing to be said about the beliefs, habits, morals and outlook on life, which obtain among the different peoples of the world except that they often differ (or)
3. "Whether it is not necessary to not find out what kind of morality, beliefs, habits and outlook have worked best and have enabled those who possessed them to flourish, to go strong, to people the earth and to have dominion over it" 

4. He then suggested that:

*"The Hindus must, therefore examine their religion and then morality in terms of their survival value"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

4. Also Hindus must consider whether they should conserve the whole of their social heritage or select what is helpful and transmit to future generations only that much and no more.
5. Secondly for his suggestion he emphasised what Prof John Dewey, who was his teacher said
⠀
*"Every Society gets encumbered with what is trivial, with dead wood from past, and with what is positively perverse...As a society becomes more enlightened, it realises that it is responsible not to conserve and transmit, the whole of its existing achievements, but only such as make for a better future"* 
*- Prof John Dewey*

6. Thirdly he suggested whether Hindus must not cease to worship the past as supplying its ideals.

⠀
*"The principle, which makes little of the present act of living and growing, naturally looks upon the present as empty and upon the future as remote. Such a principle is inimical to progress and is a hindrance to a strong and a steady current of life" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

7. Fourthly he suggested:

⠀
*"The Hindus, must consider whether the time has not come for them to recognise that there is nothing fixed, nothing eternal, nothing sanatan , that everything is changing, that change is the law of life for individuals as well as for society" - Dr. B. R Ambedkar*

*"In a changing society, there must be a constant revolution of old values and the Hindus must realise that if there must be standards to measure acts of men, there must also be readiness to revise those standards"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

Part 25:
1. He said that his views might not likely alter other's but it is their responsibility of whether they do or don't want to alter their views
2. He said he is not going to be with the National Cause, but will watch with sympathy and will give his assistance for what it may be worth

⠀
*"In the fight for Swaraj you fight with the whole nation on your side. In this (Caste), you have to fight against the whole nation and that too, your own. But it is more important than Swaraj."*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

3. He said Hindus can be defended more not by Swaraj but by removing Caste System

⠀
*"In my Opinion, only when the Hindu Society beomes a casteless society that it can hope to have strength enough to defend itself. Without such internal strength, Swaraj for Hindus may turn out to be only a step towards slavery" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

### Miscellaneous Quotes of Ambedkar:

*“Chaturvarnya is the system which deadens, paralyses and cripples the people from helpful activity"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"By not permitting readjustment of occupations, caste becomes a direct cause of much of the unemployment we see in the country" - Dr. B. R Ambedkar*

*"Nothing is infallible. Nothing is binding forever. Everything is subject to inquiry and examination"*
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*


*"The basic idea underlying religion is to create an atmosphere for the spiritual development of individual" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"Religion for man, and not man for Religion" - DR. BR Ambedkar*

*"A just society is a society in which ascending sense of Reverence and descending sense of Contempt dissolved into the creation of a compassionate society" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*


*"Right to Constitutional Remedies, the heart and soul of our Constitution" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"To diehards who have developed a kind of fanaticism against minority protection I would like to say two things. One is that minorities are an explosive force which, if it erupts, can blow up the whole fabric of state. The history of Europe bears ample and appalling testimony to this fact. The other is that the minorities in India have agreed to place their existence in the hands of majority. In the history of negotiations for preventing  the partition of Ireland, Redmond said to Carson "Ask for any safeguard you like for the protestant minority but let us have a United Ireland" Carson's reply was "Damn your safeguards, we don't want to be ruled by you." No minority in India has taken this stand." - (Constituent Assemble Debates)*

## 3. Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genisis and Development

#### Background:
1. This is a paper read by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar at an anthropological seminar at the Columbia University (seminar is of Dr. A.A. Goidenweiser)  on 9May, 1916
2. In this paper he discussed:
   1. Social Phenomenon of marriage
   2. How caste endogamy of Brahmins led to other castes around them to emulate the same 
   3. The Caste Endogamy which in turn led to broader, more imposing caste divide with the passage of time.

⠀
#### Analysis of the Paper:
1. He started reading his paper with an introduction that says many intellectuals have dealt with the task of unravelling the mysteries of Caste but still Caste remains the domain of unexplained or un-understood
2. But instead of being pessimistic he had believed that it can be known
3. Caste can be Global Problem:
4. He said Caste isn't just a local problem, it is a National and also with migration it can become a global problem too

⠀
*"The Caste problem is a vast one, both theoretically and practically. Practically, it is an institution that portends tremendous consequences. It is a local problem, but one capable of much wider mischief, for as long as caste in India does exist, Hindus will hardly intermarry or have any social intercourse with outsiders; and if Hindus migrate to other regions on earth, Indian caste would become a world problem." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

4. He agreed that theoretically many scholars have been defied by the concept of caste
5. So instead of taking caste problem as entirety, he chose to limit himself to a phase of it -> genesis, mechanism and spread of the caste system
6. Caste came to exist inspite of Homogeneity :
7. He referred to well known ethnologists and said the population of India is a mixture of Aryans, Dravidians, Mongolians and Scythians
8. These stocks of people came from various directions, with various cultures centuries ago when they were in a tribal state
9. They entered by fighting their predecessors in India and when they got enough settled as peaceful neighbours
10. And there has not been thorough amalgamation of these various people such that people from east look different from west similarly as north and south
11. But the homogeneity was in culture throughout Indian peninsula
12. Also because of  this homogeneity it became difficult to imagine the occurrence of caste which is like process of parcelling

⠀
*"I venture to say that there is no country that can rival the Indian peninsula with respect to the unity of its culture. It has not only a geographic unity, but it has over and above all a deeper and a much more fundamental unity - the indubitable cultural unity that covers the land from end to end. But it is because of this homogeneity that caste becomes a problem so difficult to be explained. If the Hindu society were a mere federation of mutually exclusive units, the matter would be simple enough. But caste is a parcelling of an already homogeneous unit, and the explanation of the genesis of caste is the explanation of this process of parcelling." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

13. Before getting into inquiry in paper, he brought into light few best students of caste for their definitions of it:
    1. Mr Senart (A french authoriy): Caste is a close corporation, in theory at any rate rigorously hereditary, equipped with a certain traditional and independent organisation, including a chief and a council, meeting on occasion in assemblies of more or less plenary authority and joining together at certain festivals; bound together by common occupations, which relate more particularly to marriage and to food and to questions of ceremonial pollution, and ruling its members by the exercise of jurisdiction, the extent of which varies, but which succeeds in making the authority of the community more felt by the sanction of certain penalties and, above all, by final irrevocable exclusion from the group." 
    2. Mr Nesfield: A caste is a class of community which disowns any connection with any other class and can neither intermarry nor eat nor drink with any but persons of their own community.
    3. Sir H. Risley: A caste may be defined as a collection of families or groups of families bearing a common name which usually denotes or is associated with specific occupation, claiming common descent from a mythical ancestor, human or divine, professing to follow the same professional callings and are regarded by those who are competent to give an opinion as forming a single homogeneous community
    4. Dr Ketkar: Caste is a social group having two characteristics: i) membership is confined to those who are born of members and includes all persons so born ii) the members are forbidden by an inexorable social law to marry outside the group

⠀
14. About the definitions he said that those definitions are dealing with Caste as an isolated unit, instead of dealing it as a Group within the system of Caste which has relation with the system
15. But he acknowledged that each one is complementary to other, emphasising what has been obscured in the other
16. So he decided to take only those points common to all castes in each of the above definitions which are regarded as peculiarities of caste and evaluate them as such
17. For Senart definition -> "idea of pollution", Ambedkar said that the idea is no means a peculiarity of caste, it usually originates from priestly ceremonialism and general belief in purity. The necessary connection of purity or pollution can be completely denied without damaging the system of Caste. It is the religious flavour that added purity and pollution concepts to caste

⠀
*"The "idea of pollution" has been attached to the institution of caste, only because the caste that enjoys the highest rank is the priestly caste, while we know that priest and purity are old associates. We may therefore conclude that the "idea of pollution" is a characteristic of caste only in so far as caste has a religious flavour."  - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

18. For Nesfield definition -> "absence of messing with those outside the caste", as one of the characteristics, he said Nesfield has mistaken effect for cause. He said Caste as being self-enclosed it automatically generates prohibition, instead it is not prohibition that generated caste. 

⠀
*"Caste, being a self-enclosed unit, naturally limits social intercourse, including messing, etc., to members within it. Consequently, this absence of messing with outsiders is not due to positive prohibition, but is a natural result of caste, i.e exclusiveness, acquired the prohibitory character of a religious injunction, but it may be regarded as a later growth."  - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

19. For Dr. Ketkar definition: He said that Ketkar has done much for the elucidation of the subject brought a critical acumen and open mind to bear on his study of caste.
    1. He said Ketkar defined caste in relation to a system of castes, and centred only on those characteristics which are absolutely necessary for the existence of a caste within a system
    2. But even in his definition Ambedkar pointed out a confusion where he opined that the two characteristics given by Ketkar for Caste are two aspects of one and same thing. which is prohibition of intermarriage and limiting membership to a group

⠀
*"He speaks of Prohibition of Intermarriage and Membership by Autogeny as the two characteristics of Caste. i submit that these are two aspects of one and the same thing, and not two different things as Dr. Ketkar supposes them to be. If you prohibit intermarriage the result is that you limit membership to those born within the group. Thus the two are the obverse and the reverse sides of the same medal." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar.*

20. From evaluation of various characteristics, he came to conclusion that the absence of intermarriage is the essential characteristic of Caste.

⠀
*"The Critical evaluation of the various characteristics of caste leaves no doubt that prohibition, or rather the absence of  intermarriage - endogamy, to be concise - is the only one that can be called the essence of caste when rightly understood." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

21. For some they, show anthropological grounds to suggest that there existed endogamy within groups without any such thing like caste system by showing examples of Negroes and Whites, various tribal groups  come under American Indians.
22. For all such he replied that Indian is different where it is having cultural homogeneity and by adding Caste system to this homogeneity, it gives a unique problem, where this is like artificial chopping of the people into groups and making their positions fixed and definite. And this chopping is done by Endogamy

⠀
*"As pointed out before, the peoples of India form a homogeneous whole. The various races of India occupying definite territories have more or less fused into one another and do possess cultural unity, which is the only criterion of a homogeneous population. Given this homogeneity as a basis, caste becomes a problem altogether new in character and wholly absent in the situation constituted by the mere propinquity of endogamous social or tribal groups."* 
*- Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"Caste in India means an artificial chopping off of the population into fixed and definite units, each one prevented from fusing into another through the custom of endogamy. Thus the conclusion is inevitable that Endogamy is the only characteristic that is peculiar to caste, and if we succeed in showing how endogamy is maintained, we shall practically have proved the genesis and also the mechanism of caste." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

23. Before explaining why he considers endogamy as a key to mystery of caste system, he goes on to explain
    1. He says that it is the Indian Society where there is survival of primitive times (religion, culture etc..)
    2. And one of the primitive survivals in the form culture, he explained was Exogamy -> where he showed its greater survival in Indian Society among other civilised societies -> where in matrimony the law centres around that the people of same kin cannot marry and marry around same gotras considered to be sacrilege.

⠀
*"The prevalence of exogamy in the primitive worlds is a fact too well-known to need any explanation. With the growth of history, however, exogamy has lost its efficacy, and excepting the nearest bloodkins, there is usually no social bar restricting the field of marriage. But regarding the people of India, the law of exogamy is a positive injunction even today. Indian society still savours of the clan system, even though there are no clans; and this can be easily seen from the law of matrimony which centres around the principle of exogamy, for it is not that Sapindas(blood-kins) cannot marry, but a marriage even between Sagotras(of same class) is regarded as a sacrilege." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

24. The inherent nature of Indian culture is exogamy, it was inherent in such a way that there are rigorous penalties for violating exogamy than there are for violating endogamy
25. Exogamy promotes social fusion and integration, which is fundamentally opposed to the concept of Caste, which creates boundaries and hierarchies through endogamy
26. But still though in final analysis the Caste has been created by superposition of endogamy on exogamy, this could be a grave problem where the population is originally exogamous, which prioritises social fusion instead of fission.

⠀
"*But we have castes; consequently in the final analysis creation of castes, so far as India is concerned, means the superimposition of endogamy on exogamy. However, in an originally exogamous population an easy working out of endogamy(which is equivalent to the creation of caste) is a grave problem, and it is in the consideration of the means utilised for the preservation of endogamy against exogamy that we may hope to find the solution of our problem." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"Thus, the superimposition of endogamy on exogamy means the creation of caste." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

27. The Problem of Caste:
    1. A Caste Group is using endogamy as means to maintain its exclusivity, so every-time it need to provide enough number of male to female or female to male to make sure that the pro generation never stops at the same time maintaining the Clan exclusivity too.
    2. So they need to dispose the widow or widower as soon as possible, so that they don't cause additional problem by intermarrying other caste. 
    3. Ways to socially neutralise of Widow:
    4. Burn her on funeral pyre of her deceased husband and get rid of her
    5. Though Burning woman seems feasible solution, it is an impractical because no matter how idealised or honoured such a practice is, it is ultimately inhuman at its worst and hard to be accepted by conscience. So Ambedkar considered this to be impractical way to solve the problem of caste disparity.
    6. So the most feasible remedy is widowhood for life. Ambedkar considered compulsory widowhood to be superior to burning because it is more practicable.
    7. Ways to socially neutralise Widower:
    8. Historically Man displayed superiority over women, and his wishes have always been consulted. So he cannot be disposed the same manner as Woman who is historically subjugated.
    9. Burning him, goes against his wish and it is highly impractically, burning men could also make them appear weak as those times strength associated with Men
    10. So even for men, Widower for life is most feasible option
    11. As many take honour in self-imposed celibacy and renouncing the world, this is not difficult to implement.
    12. If a person genuinely takes celibacy, they are as good as burned, which again shows the Caste to be weak
    13. So the Caste group instead of imposing celibacy, will keep him as a "grahasta" (one who raises a family)
    14. But the surplus man cannot be married to existing woman as she is already reserved to the unmarried man, so the surplus man will be married to the Woman who is not yet marriageable, just to tie him down to the group.
    15. (Personal: Then it arises another problem as the unmarriageable men would left out with no women when they come to marriageable age, I feel it could be possible that would be marriageable men might marry daughters or surplus men)
    16. Therefore four means to tackle the problem of disparity:
    17. Burning the window with her deceased husband
    18. Compulsory widowhood - a milder form of burning
    19. imposing celibacy on the widower 
    20. wedding him to a girl not yet marriageable
    21. All these means create an end which is creating and  perpetuating endogamy which is the prequsite for creation of Caste, and Caste is prerequisite for endogamy.
    22. Ultimately Caste and endogamy represent same thing.

⠀
*"It will now be seen that the four means by which numerical disparity between the two sexes is conveniently maintained are: (1) burning the widow with her deceased husband; (2) compulsory widowhood - amilder form of burning; (3) imposing celibacy on the widower; and (4) wedding him to a girl not yet marriageable. Though, as I said above, burning the widow and imposing celibacy on the widower are of doubtful service to the group in its endeavour to preserve its endogamy, all of them operate as means...What then is the end that these means create? They create and perpetuate endogamy,...Thus the existence of these means is identical with caste, and caste involves these means." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Castes in Hindu Society:
28. While digging the past of Hindu Society many fall into pitfalls
29. As there is no authentic or written records, also Hindus considered writing history as folly because they believe world is an illusion
30. Though History hasn't written institutions have lived on (though not written literally), the institutions, customs and morals act as fossils of their own history
31. If this is true, we just scrutinise the Solution the Hindus arrived to the Caste Problem of Widow and Widower, we might be gaining great insights
32. 3 uxorial(relating wife) customs of Hindu Society:
    1 Sati or burning of the Widow  on funeral pyre of her deceased husband
    2 Enforced widowhood by which a widow is not allowed to remarry
    3 Girl Marriage
33. Other seemingly custom is hankering of renunciation by widower
34. Ambedkar could only find the philosophy but no scientific explanation to these customs:
    1. Sati was honoured because it is a "prof of the perfect unity of body and soul" between husband and wife and of "devotion beyond the grave"
    2. Compulsory Widowhood: he haven't found any who honour compulsory widowhood but he just observed it is adhered by many
    3. Girl Marriage: He referred to the explanation of Dr Ketkar regarding the euology in honour of Girl marriage, there created a notion that a Girl should only love the Man she is married to, that includes before and after marriage, as she don't know who she has to love before marriage, at the very tender age (before sexual consciousness) she gets married so the confusion of loving is solved.
35. The ingenious sophistry (clever false arguments) tell why these institutions are honoured but not tell why they were practiced.
36. According to Ambedkar's interpretation, these institutions are first practiced and later a philosophy was weaved around it and made it to be honoured.

⠀*"This high-flown and ingenious sophistry indicates why these institutions were honoured, but does no tell us why they were practiced." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"At all times, it is the movement that is most important; and the philosophies grow around it long afterwards to justify it and give it a moral support. In like manner I urge that the very fact that these customs were so highly eulogized proves that they needed eulogy for their prevalence." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Why the instruments to neutralise Widow and Widower arose?
37. Ambedkar submits that it is to create the structure of Caste that these instruments were needed.
38. And the philosophies in honour surrounding these instruments helped in sweetening them, which in reality was shocking and abominable to the moral sense.
39. Though these means are idealised as ends, it's just hiding it's true nature in the name of ends, in reality these instruments are means which has ends in solving caste surplus men or women problem.

⠀*"I am justified in holding that, whether regarded as ends or as means, Sati, enforced widowhood and girl marriage are customs that were primarily intended to solve the problem of the surplus man and surplus woman in a caste and to maintain its endogamy. Strict endogamy could not be preserved without these customs, while caste without endogamy is a fake." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Question of Genesis/ Origin of Caste:
40. For many the origin of Caste is an annoying question to deal with some feel there are origins other feel there is origin, some dodged the question etc..
41. For Ambedkar he is clear, when he proposed Caste is nothing but a mechanism of endogamy he says, "..as I have established before, endogamy is the only characteristic of caste and when I say Origin of Caste I mean The Origin of the Mechanism for Endogamy."
42. Ambedkar opposed the atomistic conception of people, he argued that classes among people existed time immemorial in every society. And he proposed to have same view for Hindu Society too.
43. So he boiled down the research to single question, which class made itself into caste first, he assumes caste and class are not so different where Caste is an enclosed class.
44. He opined that answer to question of which class raised enclosure around itself could answer the origin of castes, but he don't have direct answer
45. So indirectly he proved the class that enclosed itself was related to Brahmin caste as all other non-brahmin castes have customs just as derivative of Brahmin caste, which they don't follow in their true character
46. Why Brahmins is another question to deal with, but it can be prove that they are originatiors of unnatural institution of caste.

⠀*"These customs in all their strictness are obtainable only in one caste, namely the Brahmins, who occupy the highest place in the social hierarchy of the Hindu Society; and as their prevalence is non-Brahmin castes is derivative, their observance is neither strict nor complete....If the prevalence of these customs in the non-Brahmin castes is derivative, as can be shown very easily, then it needs no argument to prove what class is the father of institution of caste. Why the Brahmin class should have enclosed itself into a caste is a different question, which may be left as an employment for another occasion. But the strict observance of these customs and the social superiority arrogated by the priestly class in all ancient civilisations are sufficient to prove that they were the originators of this "unnatural institution" founded and maintained through these unnatural means." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Question of growth and spread of caste system all over India:
1. How did the Caste spread to all non-brahmins from brahmins?
2. The question of spread didn't receive deserved attention, for Ambedkar it seems that question of origin and spread are same
3. According to Scholars; "The caste System has either imposed upon the docile population of India by a Law-Giver as a divine dispensation, or that it has grown according to some law of social growth peculiar to Indian people." 
4. Belief 1: The Law-Giver of India
   1. Every country has a law-giver who arises at the times of emergency to set right a sinning humanity and give it laws of justice and morality
   2. Manu is the law -giver of India, Ambedkar considered him as a daredevil fellow in crediting as a person who gave law of caste
   3. Manu couldn't outlive his law if the people got conscious that they are being subjugated to the position of brutes and being undergone suffering only to keep other class up that, just because of few line written by Manu
   4. He says Manu did not create the caste, instead he codified the already existing caste rules. The spread and growth of caste system is too gigantic for Manu to take upon

⠀*"Caste existed long before Manu. He was an upholder of it and therefore philosophised about it, but certainly he did not and could not ordain the present present order or Hindu Society. His work ended with the codification of existing caste rules and the spreading of Caste Dharma . The Spread and growth of caste system is too gigantic a task to be achieved by the power or cunning of an individual or class." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

5. Similar argument is the theory that Brahmin class couldn't have been sole creators and spreaders of caste
*"The Brahmins may have been guilty of many things. and I dare say they were, but the imposing of the caste system on the Brahmin Population was beyond their mettle. They may have helped the process by their glib philosophy, but they certainly could not have pushed their scheme beyond their own confines." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

6. Though Brahmins may have contributed for Caste System they don't have enough power or it is extremely difficult if not impossible for a group to fully mould society, especially when it wants to put everyone inferior to it
7. At same time Ambedkar criticises the irrational reasoning of some orthodox Hindus that the Caste System is present in Shashtras(similar to doctrine given by law-giver) and whatever that is there in Shastras is true.
8. He points of that this belief in particular is dangerous to the Human perception as here the Religious scriptures are being equated to Scientific Truth, shutting down rational questioning and critical inquiry.
9. He made clear his agenda, he urged on this adverse effects of this attitude, not because religious sanctity should be based on scientific basis, not because he wants to support the reformers who are preaching agains religious sancityt.
10. All he wanted to show is the falsity of attitude that equates religious sanction to the position of scientific explanation

*"I have urged so much on the adverse side of this attitude, not because the religious sanctity is grounded on scientific basis, nor to help those reformers who are preaching against it. Preaching did not make the caste system neither will it unmake it. My aim is to show the falsity of the attitude that has exalted the religious sanction to the position of scientific explanation." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

11. He concluded that the great man's theory does not help in solving the spread of Castes in India.
12. Critique on Western. Scholars: Though they did not give in to hero worship, they attempted other explanations; The typical explanation is about "nuclei" around which Caste formed; and according to them the Nuclei are
    1. Occupation
    2. Survivals of Tribal organisations, etc..
    3. the rise of new belief
    4. Cross-breeding and
    5. Migration
13. He argued Western Scholars and their Nuclei theory with the Question that are these Nuclei Peculiar to India or they existed other parts of the world, if so then why is it that Caste hasn't been formed anywhere else.

⠀*"The question may be asked whether these nuclei do not exist in other societies and whether they are peculiar to India. If they are not peculiar to India, but are common to the World, why is it that that did not "form" caste on other parts of this planet? Is it because those parts are holier than the land of Vedas, or that the professors are mistaken? I am afraid that the latter is the truth." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

7. He commented that the Western theories related to Nuclei are nothing but filling illustrations, he referred what Mathew Arnold means with the saying "grand name without grand thing in it".
8. He criticised the theories of Western Scholars revolving around Nuclei as "Petitio Princippi" of formal logic. Where the logic is proved by using the already assumed logic, example: God exists because Bible says so, and Bible is word of God; here the logic is proven by already assumed logic of Bible is God's word. 
9. Ambedkar questions Nesfield as his theory only explicits that Caste is functional or occupational and Functional or occupational group turned into caste, but Nesfield did not spare to explain mechanism why the Functional or Occupational group turned into Caste.
10. Ambedkar says Nefield theory is typical of theories from Western Scholars

⠀
### **Ambedkar's View on Caste System:**
1. There's class system like everywhere else in India: Which is divided into Four Classes 1) Brahmans or Priestly Class 2) Kshatriya or Military Class 3) Vaisya or Merchant Class 4) Sudra or artisan and menial class
2. This class system is not rigid at first and there exist mobility according to their qualifications
3. Some point in time in the history, the priestly class detached from mobilising caste system and through a closed door policy became a caste by Itself.
4. And according to the law of social division of labour, the other classes underwent differentiation into large or minute groups, most of the groups come from the classes of Shudras and Vyshyas
5. Though the sub-division according to occupation is natural, they included the unnatural aspect of self-enclosed units called Castes by which they closed the mobilising open door character of Caste System

⠀*"At some time in the history of the Hindus, the priestly class socially detached itself from the rest of the body of people and through a close-door policy became a caste by itself. The other classes being subject to the law of social division of labour underwent differentiation, some into larger, others into very minute groups...This sub-division  of a society is quite natural. But the unnatural thing about these sub-divisions is that they have lost the open door character of the class-system and have become self-enclosed units called castes." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

6. There comes the question now that, were they compelled to close the doors and become endogamous or they voluntarily closed it
7. For Ambedkar there's a double line of answer, "Some closed the door: Other found it closed Against them. The one is a psychological interpretation and the other is mechanistic, but they are complementary and both are necessary to explain the phenomenon of caste formation in its entirety" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

⠀
#### Psychological Interpretation (Voluntarily closing door)
1. The Psychological Interpretation (Some Closed the Door):
   1. Firstly the Question that needs to be tackled is: Why did the functional, industrial, religious groups became self-enclosed (endogamous)
   2. The Answer Ambedkar gave was: "Brahmins were so", endogamy originated from Brahmins and it became a fashion eventually
   3. Slowly it was imitated by sub-divisions and in turn they became endogamous
   4. Ambedkar argued that the propensity (Natural inclination) to imitate is deep-routed one in human-mind.
   5. He also emphasised that this quality of imitation need not be considered as inadequate explanation for  formation of castes
   6. He even referred to Walter Bagehot's argument: Imitation is not voluntary, instead it is hardly felt to exist, the main precursor for the imitation is the belief and the causes that make us either believe or not believe are still limited to obscurity. Also there's no doubt regarding imitative nature of credulity(blind faith)
   7. He even mentioned the laws of imitation stipulated by Gabriel Tarde which are as follows:
      1. Imitation flows from higher in social hierarchy to lower in social hierarchy
      2. Extent/ Intensity of imitation is inversely proportional to the Social distance. 
   8. Ambedkar further goes on to say that no matter the distance in space the daily repeated interaction would keep the influence of Superior groups close
   9. And he emphasised that this law of Imitation of nearest, of the least distant explains the gradual and consecutive character of the spread of a norm that is set by higher social ranks (presumably Brahmins)

⠀*"It is the infection of imitation that caught all these subdivisions on their onward march of differentiation and has turned them into castes." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

*"Walter Bagehot argues that we must not think...of imitation as voluntary, or even conscious. On the contrary it has its seat mainly in very obscure parts of the mind, whose notions, so far from being consciously produced, are hardly felt at the time. The main seat of the imitative part of our nature is our belief, and the causes predisposing is to believe that are among the obscurest parts of our mind. But as to the imitative nature of credulity there can be no doubt." - Dr. B. R. Ambekar*

*"In fact, the influence of the model's example is efficaciously inversely to its Distance as well as directly to its superiority. Distance is understood here in its sociological meaning." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

2. Though he felt his theory of imitation need no proof, he went on to prove it
3. First is to find if the vital condition for imitation exist in Hindu Society and those conditions are
   1. Source of imitation must enjoy prestige in the group 
   2. there must be numerous and daily relations among members of the group
4. These conditions do exist in India where the Brahmins held highest social hierarchical position

⠀*"The conditions for imitation, according to this standard authority are: (1) That the source of imitation must enjoy prestige in the group and (2) that there must be 'Numerous and daily relations' among the members of group. That these conditions were present in India there is little reason to doubt. The Brahman is a semi-god and very nearly a demi-god. He sets up a mode and moulds the rest. His prestige is unquestionable and is the fountain head of bliss and good. Can such a being, idolised by Scriptures and venerated by the priest ridden multitude, fall to to project his personality on the supplant humanity? Why, if the story be true, he is believed to be the very end of creation. Such a creature is worthy of more than mere imitation, but at least of imitation; and if he lives in an endogamous enclosure, should not the rest follow his example? Frail humanity! Be it embodied in a grave philosopher or a frivolous house-maid, it succumbs, It cannot be otherwise. Imitation is easy and invention is difficult." - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

5. Attitude of non-Brahman classes towards the customs that supported the custom of Caste
   1. Regarding this he stressed that their attitude depends on the Distance(sociological sense) 
   2. The nearest would observe all three customs (Caste(endogamy), Widowhood and Girl Marriage
   3. A little further would have observed widowhood and girld marriage
   4. The furthest would have observed Caste Principle(endogamy)
   5. This goes till the point the belief becomes unconscious in minds of people 
6. He used an expression to convey the caste engraved in the minds of people which goes like: "in the course in the history, it became embedded in the Hindu mind and hangs there to this day without any support for now it needs no prop but belief-like a weed on the surface of a pond". - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar
7. The imperfections in imitation might be credited partly to the barabarious character of these customs and partly to the distance(sociological)
8. Ultimately he proclaims that it is the Brahmin caste which is considered to be the servant of God set up the pattern that is duly followed or derived by other subdivisions

⠀*"This phenomenon is a complete illustration of Tarde's Law and leaves no doubt that the whole process of caste formation in India is a process of imitation of the higher by the lower...After what I have said in the role of imitation in the spread of these customs among the non-Brahman castes, as means or as ideals, though the imitaters have not been aware of it, they exist among them as derivatives; and if they are derived, there must have been prevalent one original caste that was high enough to have served as a pattern for the rest. But in a theocratic society, who could be the pattern but the servant of God?" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

#### Mechanistic Process of Caste Formation (Closing the Doors of others)
1. Ambedkar used the word mechanistic because, the closing of doors is inevitable
2. If a Group A becomes exclusive in a Classroom, the remaining members has no option but to become exclusive too
3. This exclusivity is not because they wanted it, but because they have no other way
4. He criticised the previous scholars that they treated System of caste and Caste and same, which he disagrees and says Caste is the part of System of Caste
5. He further remarked that Caste exists only in plurality

⠀*"Caste in the singular number is an unreality. Caste exists only in the plural number."  - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

6. Then he clearly clarifies that in the process of making themselves exclusive, Brahmins have made non-brahmins exclusive too, so non-brahmins becoming a caste group is sheer circumstance.

⠀*"I will clear my point by taking another illustration. Take India as a whole with its various communities designated by the various creeds by which they owe allegiance, to wit, the Hindus, Muhammadans, Jews, Christians and Parsis. Now, barring the Hindus, the rest within themselves are non-caste communities. But with respect to each other they are castes. Again, if the first four enclose themselves, the Parsis are directly closed out, but are indirectly closed in. Symbolically if group A wants to be endogamous, group B has to be so by sheer force of circumstances." -  Dr. B. R. Ambedkar*

7. Now by applying same logic to the Hindu Society we can understand the  parcelling or fissiparious nature of Caste
8. Caste has nature of self-preservation and self-duplication so any of the recalcitrant(repulsive or non cooperative) to the caste are thrown out
9. Especially when caste rules are inflexible or inexorable, any kind of innovation is taken as offence.
10. There's no mercy for a sinner who has courage to violate the code, the penalty is exocommunication and the result is a new caste.
11. Also the Hindu Psychology encourages the exocommunicated to form themselves a caste
12. Also the Hindu Psychology is also willing to humble the members of higher preference caste to admit in its fold
13. Such a the caste groups enclosing themselves, are also closing out the groups that are obnoxious the caste rules and compelling them to convert into a caste which says about the bewildering multiplicity

⠀*"Innovation maybe of any kind, but all kinds will suffer the same penalty. A novel way of thinking will create a new Caste for the old ones will not tolerate it. The noxious thinker respectfully called Guru (Prophet) suffers the same fate as the sinners in illegitimate love. The former creates a caste of the nature of a religious set and the latter a type of mixed caste. Castes have no mercy for a sinner who has the courage to violate the code. The penalty is excommunication and the result is a new caste."* - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

Ambedkar's final Summarisation of his thesis:
1. First he opined that many students of Caste have misled their investigation
2. European Students of Caste unduly emphasised the role of colour where they themselves are impregnated by colour prejudices
3. Regarding European Students, he pointed to the statement of Dr. Katekar, where he says that All the prices belong to so-called Aryan race or so-called Dravidian race belong to Aryans only, the colour seized to be matter of importance, and it is the western scholars that started drawing the line.
4. And he also criticised them for taking mere characteristics as explanations like occupations, religion etc..
5. He says we need to yet to find why occupational group became caste but this question was never raised by the Western students of Caste
6. He says Caste itself though relies on belief, it cannot be sustained, it needs constant fortification and perpetuation
7. Finally he basis his thesis on four main points:

⠀
"My Study of the Caste Problem involves four main points:
1. That inspite of composite make up of the Hindu Population there is a deep cultural unity
2. That caste is parcelling into bits of larger cultural unit
3. That there was one caste to start with
4. That classes have become castes through imitation and exocommunication" - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

⠀
8. He also touched upon the reformers who wants to do away with this unnatural institution where he says, they could find the food for their thought in this these if they are with the view of "caste is an unconscious growth in life of human society under perculiar" conditions rather than originated from the doctrine of a law giver.
9. He also stresses that he is not presumptuous to think his thesis as final
10. All he wants is to show the path which he regard to be the right path
11. He also emphasised to guard against the sentiments, as sentiments be kept away from science
12. He says that he also welcomes the destruction of his own Ideology
13. He concludes that if someone proves his theory to be wrong, he is willing to give it up.

⠀
*"I am not, however, so presumptuous as to think them in any way final, or anything more than a contribution to a discussion of the subject...We must, however, guard against approaching the subject with a bias. Sentiment must be outlawed from the domain of science and things shovld be judged from an objective standpoint...For myself I shall find as much pleasure in a positive destruction of myown idealogy, as in a rational disagreement on a topic,...To conclude, while I amambitious to advance a Theory of Casie, if it can be shown to be untenable I shall be equally willing to give it up."* - Dr. B. R. Ambedkar
