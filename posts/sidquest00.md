"Hey you! Who are you? What do you Want?"

It was a quiet, sunlit morning by the Godavari. The river shimmered under the warmth of an early summer sky, its waters catching bits of sunlight like scattered gold. Sid stood by the bank, the breeze warm against his skin, when a figure appeared through the shimmer. An old man, with a thick black beard and long matted hair, walked toward him. Clad in faded saffron robes, he looked every bit like those ascetics who had stepped away from the world, yet never truly left it.

"I’m just washing myself, sir," Sid replied.

"Ohh you don't look like someone from around here"

"Yes i don't belong here, I came from far away place. I am just a Wanderer"

The old ascetic looked at him curiously. There was something unusual about the boy, he didn’t quite seem the wandering kind. His clothes were clean, his voice steady, and there was a trace of comfort in the way he stood, like someone who had not known real hardship yet. He looked more like a boy from a good home than one lost on the road.

"Ohh, but you don't look like one" 

"So wanderers are having a identity code now?" Sid smiled faintly.

"It is not like that it's just that you look too young, well educated and seems to be the one that lived in a wealthy household."

"You are almost correct of everything, I am young, two days back itself i turned 26, I come from a rich household, but there’s one thing you got wrong, you think I am educated. But i consider myself not”

"What kind of rich family skips their child’s education?"

"In the sense of certification from educational institutions i am having many, but i don't consider it to be the Actual Education. And I am in search of it"

"Ohh so that's why you became a wanderer?”

"Yes"

"You ran away from home?"

"No, my search made me travel away”

“Ohh okay, i got it,  If you are in the search of Actual education, you should wash yourself properly"

"What do you mean Sir?"

"I just mean wash yourself properly"

"Ohh that sounds philosophical but philosophy isn't the answer for me, i have read many philosphical and religious texts and none gave me the answer, all i felt of them was, dry words, and nothing in them gave me the actual Education."

"Ohh in that case i wish you find your Actual Education soon"

"Thankyou Sir, it was nice meeting you" 

"Same here, All the Best for your Quest…, ohh wait What's your Name?"

"It's Sid Sir" 

"Okay all the Best for your Sidquest!"
