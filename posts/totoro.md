**Personal Note:**	

Fight Club is such a movie that connects to a set of audience, especially the ones that feel alienated from life itself. It is the spiritual journey of a Person who is seeking the validation for his existence.

For me it hits different every time I watch, for the first time I was lured into idealising Pain and Nihilism, later I realised it is about finding what truly matters, now I am seeing it as a viewpoint of a lonely alienated man towards Human life and meaning of existence. The special aspect of the character they emphasised is abandonment of father. 

In his spiritual journey the protagonist comes across various ideas and slowly moves towards the point which he assumes it to be the bottom. That bottom he implies as the point where you realise yourself as Nothing but decomposing organic material. I felt that the character’s journey is prompted by the consumeristic lifestyle. As he questions the life of consumerism, what really matters and who we are really, what ultimately matters to our existence and all such it is clearly evident that he is rebelling against the consumeristic lifestyle.

He realises that, for one to hit bottom, they had to endure enough pain, they shouldn’t shut it out, “Without Pain, without Sacrifice you would have Nothing.” This point especially emphasised through the lens of a Child whose father bailed him and ultimately perceives even God rejected him. So he rejects validation itself and instead goes after something that makes him feel alive or in his language makes him hit the bottom. In that attempt he creates FIGHT CLUB…

To me Fight Club earned a special place in my heart, though I don’t idealise it completely, the Character of Narrator has super relativity with my own character and views. Sometimes I see it as my guide for actualising my views and perspective and,  sometimes I see it as warning of how I could turn out with my views.
