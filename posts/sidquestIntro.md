Before everything else, I will give a brief introduction about myself. I am the author of this story, “The Sidquest”. Basically, I am a Buddhist. I cannot vouch for being a proper religiious Buddhist, but I do practice Buddhism mostly its principles and Doctrine. To enrich my spiritual journey, I recently started reading the Dhammapada, a compilation of timeless wisdom shared by the Buddha. 

I read a new concept from Dhammapada each day, but I felt like something was missing, something with a real-life touch. Unfortunately, my lifestyle doesn’t encourage me to freely explore life out there (that’s a different story though). 

Then I thought, if I’m not exposed to new experiences, why not create new experiences myself? With that thought, this story called “The Sidquest” was born. It’s basically a spiritual journey of a young man. You’ll find more details as you dive into the story. 

I will release this story in chapters and parts, each of which includes a subtle reference to the Dhammapada, woven with a dramatic build. So, I hope you all enjoy it. Happy reading!
