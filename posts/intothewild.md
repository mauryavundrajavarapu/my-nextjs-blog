**“Happiness is only real, when shared.”**
Let’s start from that last line, happiness is only real when shared. Here Christopher says that Happiness is real when shared, probably he is mentioning that we get happiness when it is shared with people, which is absolutely true and one can experience it in real life. But sharing is done not just with people, but every being of this Universe. When you throw a person into an Island with no humans, he makes up an imaginary friend to share their life with. 

Usually a solitary person finds happiness in reading or art, which is nothing but sharing their happiness of knowing or reading or creating with universe. (I could be over interpreting the statement, but it is what I feel). Happiness comes from sharing it doesn’t matter with whom and how. Well that’s the whole point of me creating this BLOG in the first place.

“Ultimate Freedom” it is the philosophy of Christopher; All his life he has been confined by the pressures of parents and society, he felt they are stripping away his freedom in the name of comfortable life. He decided to leave the society and be a Tramp. The inspiration and company he got for embarking such a journey came through the characters of his favourite Literature. 

He realised that it is important to Feel Strong than be strong…I don’t understand why exactly, could be that feeling such way is the first step to cast off the shackles that are binding our freedom. He went from place to place, reading, writing and experiencing new adventures, people and places.

A Quiet Secluded Life, Being Useful to People, Doing Good, Doing Work that have some use, Rest, Nature, Books, Music, Love for one’s neighbour this his definition of his happiness. 

One has to measure themselves at least once, to find themselves at least once in the most ancient human conditions?. He always romanticised the idea of Living in Wild, living in that moment and getting out of this sick society. For him things are shackles of his freedom. 

The Joy of Life don’t just come from human relationships, according to him God has placed the Joy in everything and anything that we can experience.  It is just we need to change the way we look at those things…
