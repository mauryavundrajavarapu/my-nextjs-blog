# Freedom from the Known
#personality/books

### Chapter 1: Man’s Search
#### The Tortured Mind:
1. Human kind is always in search of something that is beyond material welfare, something which it calls God or Truth
2. They keep asking what is this all about, what’s the menaing of life? As they can only see the enormous dismay of life, the brutalities, the revolts, the wars, the endless divisions of relgions, ideology and antiaonality, they stumble with the question What should one do in this life? What is living? Is there beyond living?
3. But the lack of answers to their existential questions gives rise to Torutred Mind,

#### The Traditional Approach:
1. Their inability to solve the existential questions made them see faith (either in a saviour or ideal)
2. This fiath on outward things breeds violence.
3. So to cope up with living, We set ourselves a code of conduct according to which we should act or thinkm this code of conduct depends on the society we are dwelling in.
4. In process of creating a code of conduct we look to someone to tell what is right or wrong, in seeting up this conduct we ouselves become mechanical and our responses become automatic.
5. Throughout the centuries we have been spoonfeed by authorities, books, teachers and saints.
6. Because of this spoonfeeding, whatever we know from them is second-hand there’s nothing original of our in it. Ultimately we became the result of all kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in is, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves, nothing original, pristine, clear.
7. For example a Mother sees her motherhood through the lens of society and takes honour in it, as Society said it is honourable. There’s no original though for her of what she should be doing.
8. When it comes to Religions; they profss certain rituals, practices and patterns to follow like suppress our passions, being moderate and refrain from sexual indulgence, disciplined etc..
9. But that tortured mind which was made dull through discipline and conformity will see only through oits own distortion ( a religious persons sees everything as i am doing x or not doing x so i will get heaven)
10. This traditional approach teaches on to become narrow in their outlook ultimately reaching a state where there is no more epxloration of mind as it becomes incapable, dull and insensitive.

*“The traditional approach is from the periphery inwards, and through time, practice and renunciation, gradually to come upon that inner flower, that inner beauty and love - in fact to do everything to make oneself narrow, petty and shoddy; peel off little by little; take time; tomorrow will do, next life will do - and when at last one comes to the centre, one finds there is nothing there because one’s mind has been made incapable, dull, and insensitive.”*  - J. Krisnamurti

#### The Trap of Respectability:
1. The primary disorder in ourselves is because we are seeking a reality that is promisied by another, we mechanically follow somebody.
2. Though we are opposed to political tyranny and dictatorship, we inwardly accpet the aithroity and the tyranny of another to twist our minds, our way of life.
3. By rejecting all the dogmas and ideas and authority of others we stand alone in the society and we cease to be respectable human
4. And the respectable human cannot possibly come near to that infinite, immeasurable reality.
5. When you reject all those dogmas and beliefs actually, instead just rejecting them intellectually saying doing pooja is stupid i will do prayer etc.., then you will create a deep disturbance in yourself and around but you will step out of trap of respectability.
6. Rejection should come from deep understanding not just from shallow emotioanl response
7. Then you will stop seeking, becuase when you are seeking truth here and there you are just window-shopping
8. When you seek; you jump from one book to other, one guru to other, all just an illusion of finding something in relaity you are just window shopping.

#### The Human Being and the Individual, The Battle of Existence, The Basic Nature of Man
1. Whatever Spiritual Truth is there, it can be discovered only by self.
2. To understand oneself is the begenning of wisdom.
3. There’s a difference between a Human Being and the individual, the individual is local entity where as human being is the collective.
4. Individual Entity is concerened with fame, status, personal problems etc..wheareas Human being is concerend with total welfare, total misery and total confusion of the world.
5. As Humans BEings we are strange misture of hate, fear, and gentleness, violence and peace.
6. Though there is drastic change in outward world from bulloc cart to jet plane the inward psychology of individual did not chnage much.
7. Whatever change we are seeing outward is due to the inward pyschology of individual.

*“The outward social structure is the result of the inward oyschological structure of our human relatonships, for the individual is the result of the total experience, knowledge and conduct of man. Each one of us is the storehous of all the past.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

9. And this basic nature or pyschology of man is fear, we are naturally afraid of what’s happeing withing ourself and around ourself in the competitive culture we live, we are also afraid of the unknown that is beyond our scope of understanding like Death.
10. All the outward forms of chnage through wars, reformations, laws and ideologies failed to change the basic nature of man and society.
11. Can this mistrosity of human life with compettion, brutality and  fear come to an end? As a fact? Such that a new world altogher be created.
12. The only way it happens is through individual recognition as human being, and realising that the human  being is responsible for the whole state of the world.

*“We are each one of us responsible for every war because of the aggressiveness of our own lives, because of our nationalism, of our selfishness, our gods, our prejudices, our ideals, all of which divide us. And only when we realize, not intelllectually but actuallly, as actually as we would recognise that we are hungry or in pain, that you and I are responsible for all this existing chaos, for all the misery throughout the entire world because we have contributed to it in our daily lives and are part of this mosntrous society with its wars, divisions, its ugliness, brutality and greed - only then will we act.”* - J. Krishnamurti

#### Responsibility and Truth:
1. What can a Human do? Follow a philosophy? a ideology? a relgion? a pattern? a person?etc..
2. We have been told all paths lead to truth, which in itself is absurd as truth has no path, Truth is living it is not static.
3. When we observe this Truth which is living, moving, which has no restign place then we will understand this living thing is what we are; our agner, our brutality, our violence, our despair, our agonny and sorrow we live in (We are the Truth?)
4. To understand this truth, we need to look at those things (our anger, our brutality, our violence, our despain etc..) in our life
5. One cannot look through ideology, thorugh a screen of words, through hopes and fears.
6. Personal Note: Krishnamurti suggests that the Truth which is alive and ever-changing cannot be reached through fixed ideologies or traditions, it can only observed through direct observation of oneself, free of conditioning. That is why the ideas themselves are evolving for example: from treating women as property to fighting for women rights.

*“A dead thing has a path to it because it si static, but when you see that truth is something living, moving, which has no resting place, which is in no temple mosque or church, which no religion, no teacher, no philosopher, nobody can lead you to - then you will also see that this livign thing is what you actually are - your anger, your brutality, your violence, your despair, the agaony and sorrwo you live in. In understanding of all this is the truth, and you can understand it only if you know how to look at those things in your life. And you cannot look through an ideology, through a screen of words, through hopes and fears.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

7. By understanding that we cannot and do not depend on anyone, any guide or teacher.
8. There’s only US, Our Relationship with others and with the World and nothing else. 
9. When we realise this there is either cynicism and bitterness as we feel abandoned and isolated to help ourselves as there’s nothing depend on.
10. But there’s also another response, in facing the fact we are responsible for everything we stop seeking and all the self-pity goes, now we will be truly thinking about solution.

*“When you realise this(there’s no guide..only you, your relationship with others and with the world and there is nothing else), it either beings great despair, from which comes cynicism and bitterness, or, in facing the fact that you and nobody else are responsible for the world and for yourself, for what you think, what you feel, how you act, all self-puty goes. Normally we thrive on blamming others, which is a form of self-pity”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Self-Transofrmation:
1. Can we bring a total revolution within ourselves, a completel psychological mutation where we no longer are angry, anxious, afraid, envious, or any such manifestation that create rotten society?
2. JK is not suggesting any philosophy or theological structure, what he is suggesting is about observing ourselves.
3. By observing ourselves doensn’t mean intellectually(attaching our intellectual beliefs to what we observe) but actually dealing with totality of life, just seeing what it is.
4. When we truly observe we understand there is no outward world and inward world, all the world is one unitary existence and manifestation.
5. To look at this all we need, when we know how to look everything becomes so clear. 
6. There’s no need for anyone telling how to look, you just need to look.

#### Dissipation and Freedom from Authority:
1. By observign ourselves can we self transform? Can we bring revolution in the pysche?
2. If you ask for a way then what you are seeking is not the change but a mere way that’s it.
3. By following someone we are creating a authority in ourself of another, we live in a way but expect to live in the wya told by the authority, utimately leading a double life, all the while tryign to confrom to the ideolgy of that authority instead realsing our trueselves is what we actually are. 
4. By observing ourselves through the lens of another we always remain a second-hand human being.


*“If i were foolish enough to give you a system and if you were foolish enough to follow it, you would merely be copying, imitating, conforming, accepting, and when you do that you have to set up in yourself the authority of another and hence there is conflict between you and that authority. You feel you must do such and such a thing because you have been told to do it, and yet you are incapable of doing it…So you will lead a double life between the ideology of the system and the actuality of your daily existence. In trying to conform to the ideolog, you suppress yourself- whereas what is actually true is not the ideology but what you are. If you try to study yourself according to another, you will always remain a second-hand human being.”*  - J. Krisnamurti

5. A Person who says they Want to Change seems earnest but all they are doing is to seek newer authority that they hope to bring order in their life and in themself.
6. But can a authority bring order inward? The authority inward will always bring disorder.
7. But can we see this beyond intellectually, as always we put ourselves under the authority of teacher, a wife, a husband, a parent or a friend, of society?
8. The moment one says I want to chnage, the old authorty is finished and a newer authority will be set.
9. If acccept that we need to chnage completely from the fundamentals, rejecting all the traditional authoiryt on us then what takes place?
10. When you have rejected the authority you are more free, you have more energy to divert towards than to mrely subject it to conformity.

*“When you reject something false which you have been carrying about with you for generations, when you throw off a burden of any kind, what takes place? You have more energy, haven’t you? You have more capacity, more drive, greater intensity and vitality. If you do not feel this, then you have not thrown off the burden, you have not discarded the dead weigh of authority.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

11. When we threw the authority aside, then the Fear dissolves, there’s no fear of doing right or wrong. This Energy itself is the mutation. Usually we dissipate tremendous amounts of energy through fear.
12. When when the energy is not dissipated through fear, then that energy itself creates inward revolution.
13. So utlimately one is left with themselves, free from any authority, in this freedom there is energy, and when there is freedom it can never do anything wrong.
14. No Authory -> No Fear -> Freedom -> Energy to Do anything -> Great Love -> Doing what ist will

*“As you are no longer looking to anybody or anything for help, you are already free to discover. And when there is freedom, there is energy; and when there is freedom it can never do anything wrong. Freedom is entirely different from revolt. There is no such thing as doing right or wrong when there is freedom. You are free, and from that centre you act. And hence there is no fear, and a mind that has no fear is capable of great love. And when there is love, it can do what it will.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

15. Finally what we are going to do is to lear about ourselves, not accordign to any ideology or authority, because by learning according to someone else we learn about them, so we learn what we actually are.
16. Realising this, it would be diffiuclt to reject our own inward authority we built till now, but we could keep in mind that we are living things, our lives are flowing continuosly, no dead past should take away our moment of this present.

*“Having realised that we can depend on no outside authoirty in bringign about a total revolution within the structure of ouw pysche threr is the immense greater difficulty of rejecting our own inward authority, the authority of our own particular little experiences and accumulated opinions, knowledge, ideas, and ideals…To understand ourselves needs no authority either of yesterday or of a thousand years because we are livign things, always movign, flowing, never resting. When we look at ourselves with the dead authority of yesterday, we will fail to understand the living movement and the beauty and quality of that movement.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

17. To be free of authority is to DIE TO YESTERDAY, so your mind will always be fresh and energetic.
18. Only in this state one learns and observes.
19. This is the awareness required to observe what is going on inside without judging it or telling  it what is should or should not be, the moment you correct it you have established another authority.
20. Now we need to start the journey together from start, afresh by forgetting the yesterday.

*“And to take such a journey(a journey to discover ourselves) we must travel light; we cannot be burdened with opinions, prejudices, and conclusions - all that old furniture we have collected for the last two thousand years and more. Forget all you know about yourself, forget all you have ever thought about yourself, we are going to start as if we knew nothing.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Notes Ch-1:
1. I feel the whole first chapter is ulearning the reality we understood till now, so to have a fresh start that is devoid of any lens.

### Chapter 2: Learning (About ourselves - Simplicity and Humility - Conditioning)
#### About Ourselves
1. There’s no philoophy, or guide or authority.
2. Any authority, especially in the field of thought and understanding is destructive.
3. You have to be your own teacher, you own disciple and question everything that man has accepted as valuable as necessary
4. You could be lonely if you are not following anyone, but what’s wrong with being lonely, you are afraid that you are going to face with your true self of empty, dull, stupid, ugly, guilty and anxious, a petty, shoddy, second hand enitity.
5. Then face the fact, do not run away, the moment you run away fear begins.
6. We are not the part, instead we are the whole, we created the world, So we are not isolating ourselves in inquiring ourselves.
7. You must become aware of the total field of your own self, which is consciousnes of individual and of society. Only when MInd goes beyond this individual and social consiousness, you become light to yourself.

*I must become aware of the total field of my own self, which is the consiounsess of the individual and of society. It is only then, when the mind goes beyond this individual and social consciousness, that I can become a light to myself that never goes out.”*  - J, Krishnamurti

8. You can obeserve yourself only in relationship because all life is in relationship It is no use sitting in corner and meditating about yourself. You cannot exist as yourself, 
9. We exist in relationship with people, things and ideas and in studying your relationship with outward and inward things you understand yourself.
10. Learning about ourseleves is different from Aquiring Knowledge about ourselves, the latter is the process of past, collecting the past information and memories.
11. But if we are learning this movement, by listening, by watching every minute then we find that learning is constant movement without past.
12. When learning about ourselves we need to exercise sensitivity, instead of labelling it with our past ideas, we need to just observe and learn what it is.
13. Most of us are not even sensitive to their physciality, many overindulge in eating or bad habits that ruin their body.
14. There has to be sensitivity exercised in every field of our observation.

*“We may be sensitive about certain things that touch us personally, but to be completely sensitive to all the implicaions of life demands that there be no separation between organism and the pysche. It is a total movement.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

15. You must live with yourself to learn about yourself, knowing its content, its nature, its structure, its movement. 
16. Then you will know the you are not static but fresh livinng thing. And to live with livign thing your mind must be alive and it cannot be alive if it is caught with opinions and judegements and values.

*“To understand anything you must live with it, you must observe it, you must know all its content, its nature, its structure, its movement. Have you ever tried livign with yourself? If so, you will begin to see that yourself is not a static state, it is a fresh, living thing. And to live a lviign thing your mind must also be alive. And it cannot be alive if it is caught in opinions, judgements, and values.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

17. To obeseve your whole being, you should have free mind. Not a mind that agrees with one and disagrees with other, taking sides in argument, disputing over mere words, but following with an intention to understand.
18. This Free Mind and intention to understand is very difficult.
19. When our mind is constantly chattering and arguing we cannot see ourselves, we only see the projections we have made of ourselves. 
20. Each projection has an image of what we think we are or what we should be, that imaga, that picture, entirely prevents us from seeing ourselves as we actually are.

#### Simplicity and Humility:
1. It is most difficult to look at anything because our minds lost the quality of simplicity.
2. The Simplicity is not about clothes we wear, food we eat etc..but simplicity in looking directly at things without fear, that to look at ourselves as we actually are, without distortion (to say when we lie, we lie, not cover it up or run away from it)
3. To understand ourselves, we need great deal of humility, to say ‘I know myself’ is the moment we stop learning about ourselves.
4. The moment you learn yourself from memories and experiences, you stop learning yourself.
5. The moment you feel you achieved something, you cease the quality of innocence and humility
6. The moment you have a conclusion or start, you are finsished, for then you are translating every living thing in terms of old,
7. When there is no past, no achievement, no certainity then there is freedom to look, to achieve.

*“Whereas if you have no foothold, if there is no certainty, no achievement, there is frreedom to look, to achieve. And when you look with freedom, it is always new. A Confident man is dead human being.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Conditioning:
1. But how can we look and learn when we are conditioned by the Society the moment we born, through nationality, caste, class, tradition, religion, language, education, literature, art, custom, convention, propaganda of all kinds, economic pressure, the food we eat, the climate we live in, our family, our freinds, our experiences, our responses to every problem is conditioned through some kind of past experience.
2. The first thing one should ask oneself is “Are you aware that you are conditioned?”.
3. Asking “How to be free frolm Conditioning?” is pointless as you can never be free from it.
4. You should ask that if you are aware
5. Your response to every challenge or problem shows that you are conditioned, as your response will be according to your conditioning, if you conditioning is inadequate you will always react inadequately.
6. When you become aware of this conditioning, you will either feel imprisoned by it or satisfied.
7. When your conditioning is in conflict of continuity of pleasure or the avoidance of pain then you will see that conditioning as imprisonemnt.
8. If everything is perfectly happy around you you wouldn’t see that you are conditioned in first place.
9. The moment there’s disturbance, we realise that we are consitioned.

*“You will be able to see for yourself how you are conditioned only when there is conflict in the continuity of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. If everything is perfectly happy around you, your wife loves you, you love her, you have a nice house, nice children and plenty of money, then you are not aware of your conditioning at all. But when there is disturbance, when your wife looks at someone else or you lose your money or are threatened with war or any other pain or anxiety - then you know you are conditioned.”* - J. Krishnamurti

37. We are always disturbed with eveything happening aournd us (politics, economic situation, atrocities, brutalities, suffering etc..)
38. But should we do anything or just live with it and get used to it?
39. We get used to them by blaming them, pushing the blame on circumstances, on others or on environment or on the economic situation
40. By getting used to disturbance, we get duller and duller, just that being so used to beauty around as we become so ignorant of it when it is abundant. 
41. But at same time if we do not get used to it, we try to escape it through taking some drug, shouting, wrtiitng, joining a poltical group, going to football match or to temple or church, or some other amusement.
42. But why escape? To understand a fact we must look into it, but not escape it, not run away from it.
43. We need to realise that we are afraid ( not for this or that, we are just afraid)

*“Most of us are afraid for our family, afraid of public opinion, of losing our job, our security, and hundreds of other things. The simple fact is that we are afraid, not that we are afraid of this or that. Now, why cannot we face that fact?”*  - J. Krishnamurti

44. If we are always escaping it, we cannot face it, we can face it only in the present.

*“You can face a fact only in the present, and if you never allow it to be present because you are always escaping from it, you can never face it, and because we have cultivated a whole network of escapes, we are caught in the habit of escape.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

45. Now if we can be sensitive see through the conditioning we have been through and the dangers it results, brutality and hatred it results then why don’t we act towards this conditioning like acting when we see a snake or immediate danger.
46. It is because we don’t see it (the conditioning)
47. The conditioning becomes danger only where there is emotional content to it, seeing it as mere intellectual understanding leads to nothing.

*“Through an intellectual process of analysis you may see that nationalism lead to self-destruction, but there is no emotional content in that. Only when there is an emotional content do you become vital.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

48. Seeing the conditioning as mere idea, there comes a conflict between the idea and action, such conflict takes away your energy.
49. Only when you see the conditioning and immediate danger resulting from it, you will act as if you are seeing a Snake.

*“It is only when you see the conditioning and the danger of it immediately, and as you would see a prcipice, that you act. So seeing is acting.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

50. We most of our lives walk through it inattentively, reacting unthinkingly according to our environments we brought up. This reaction causes further bondage, so but by giving complete attention to the conditioninng seeing it as immediate danger, we will be free from past completely, and it falls away from you.

*“Most of us walk through life inattentively, reacting unthinkingly according to the environment in which we have been brought ip, and such reactions create only further bondaege, further conditioning, but the moment you give your total attention to your conditioning you will see that you are free from the past completely.”* - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 3: Consiousness (The Totality of Life - Awareness)
1. When you become aware of you r conditioning, you become aware of your consciousness
2. In consciousness there exists all motives, intentions, desires, pleasures, fears, inspirations, longings, hopes, sorrows, joys.
3. There two types one is Active Consiousness and other is Dormant Subconsciousness
4. If there exists a sub-conscious mind that too is as conditioned as consious one
5. So is it possible to be totally aware of the whole field of consciousness? Not merely a part or fragrment but total of it?
6. If you become aware of this consciousness you then fucntion all you r time with total attention. Without dividin you r thought, feelinf and action into mutiple levels.
7. We usually live in fragmens, we are one thing at office, other thing at home, talk about democracy but will be autocratic.
8. Are we even aware of this fragmentary existence in ourself?
9. Is it possible to look at the whole of consciousness completley, totallly which means to be total human being?
10. UNderstanding the self layer by layer takes time, so we realise the only way to understand the self is to see immediately, not in fragments but the whole totality as truth.
11. We probabuly never done that, if we do that without blaming or explaing things away or getting freightened to look then we will give our whole attantione, whole being, everything of yourself, your eyes, your ears, your nerves, you will attend with complete self-abandonment, and then there is no room for fear, no room for contradicition and no conflict.

#### Total Awareness:
1. There’s a difference between attention and concentration, concentratio ninvolves exclusion whereas attention involves inclusion.
2. We infact are not at all aware of ourselves and our surrounding as we are occupied with our petty problems.

*“It seems to me that most of us are not aware, not only of what we are talking about but of our environment, the colours around us, the people, the shape of the trees, the clouds, the movement of water. Perhaps it is because we are so concerned with ourselves, with our own petty little problems, our own ideas, our own pleasures, pursuits, and ambitions that we are not objectively aware. And yet we talk a great deal about awareness.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

14. It is only when we care or love to understand then only we can give our whole heart and minf to find out then only we can give whole attention.

*“We are not aware of outward things or of inward things If you want to understand the beauty of a bird, a fly, or a leaf, or a person with all his complexities, you have to give your whole attention, which is awareness. And you can give whole attention only when you care, which means that you really love to understand then you give your whole heart and mind to find out.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

15. It is something similar to looking at a Snake in the room, observing the moments and such a state of attention is total enerhgy, in such awareness the totality of yourself is reveled in an instant.
16. In understanding or lloking at ourself we go deeper, not in comparison with others, because in the comparison you are looking at the others and denying what you are.
17. When you are hungery you realsie that you are hungry instead of comparing with yesterday’s hunger or so
18. You mind is no longer seekign when you put away comparison, collecing knowledge bit by bit from past, identifying yourself with saviour or an ideology, any such process that lead only to greater conformisty and greater conflict.

*“When i have understood that comparision in any form leads only to greater illusion and greater misery, just when I analyse myself, add to my knowledge of myself bit by bit, or identyfy myself with something outside myself, whether it be the State, a saviour or an ideology - when I understand that all such processes lead only to greater conformity and therefore greater conflict - when I see all this I put it completely away. Then my mind is no longer seeking. It is very important to understand this.”* - J. Krishnamurti

19. By understanding this, you mind will be free of illusion, such mind moves in totally different dimension.
20. The deminesion we live is filled with pain, pleasure and suffering, fear etc…then mind functions without conflict, without send of otherness.

*“The dimension in which we usually live, the life of every day which is pain, pleasure and fear, has conditioned the mind, limited the nature of the mind, and when that pain, pleasure and fear have gone (which does not mean that you no longer have joy; joy is something entierley different from pleasure) - then the mind fucntions in a different dimension in which there is no conflict, no sense of otherness.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

21. The Actuality can be explained till the point it can be explained, beyond that no words can explain it.
22. It is the Daily awareness and attention that is going to open the door that lets us see the actuality. Which no words can explain.
23. This Awarenss and Attention, is attained through awareness of How We Speak, What we say, How we walk, what we think.
24. It is something like cleaning the room, cleaning the room, you clean the room not because it opens the door and breeze will come in, you clean the room to be sane, rational, virtuous and orderly. If one is lucky, attain the mindset of being aware of their mind, withotut attempting to influence it. Then the Dorr might open and breeze comes in.

*“What will open the door is daily awareness and attention - awareness of how we speak, what we say, how we walk, what we think. It is like cleaning a room and keeping it in order...There must be order in the room, but order will not open the door or the window, What will open the door is not your volition or desire…All that you can do is to keep the room in order, which is to be virtuous for itself, not for what it will bring. To be sane, rational, orderly. Then perhaps, if you are lucy, thw window will open and the breeze will come in. Or it may not. It depends on the state of mind. And that state of mind can be understood only by yourself, by watching it and never trying to shape it, never taking sides, never opposing, never aggreeing, never justifying, never condemning, nver judging - which means watching it without any choice. And out of this choiceless awareness perhaps the door will open, and you will know what the dimension is in which there is no conflict and no time.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 4: Pursuit (of Pleasure - Desire - Perversion by Thought - Memory - Joy)
#### Pursuit of Pleasure
1. Joy is something etirely different from Pleasure.
2. Then What is Pleasure, can we live with Joy in a world devoid of Pleasure?
3. We are all engaged in Pursuit of Pleasure in some form or other (intellectual sensuous, cultural, social, etc..)
4. Pleasure is main proponent in structure of Society, we from childhood are guided by it.
5. So one should observe to where that Pleasure is guiding us and how it is shaping our lives. 
6. One should investigate into this Question of Pleasure, then they should nourish and sustain it, as it is basic demand of Life. Without it most life would lose the meaning.

*“Pleasure is the structure of society. From childhood until death we are secretly, cunningly or obviously pursuiing pleasure. So whatever our form of pleasure is, I think we should be very clear about it because it is going to guide and shape our lives. It is therefore important for each one of us to investigate closely, hesitantly, and delicately this question of pleasure, and then nourish and sustain it, is a basic demand of Life, and without it existence becomes dull, stupid, lonely and meaningless.”* - J. Krishnamurti

7. Then why not Pursue Pleasure?
8. The Pursuit of Pleasure brings pain, frustration, sorrow, and fear and, out of fear, violence. 
9. One can live that way with the pursuit of Pleasure like most of the world. But if they want to come out of it, they should understand the structure of Pleasure.
10. Understanding Pleasure means to not deny it, neither condemning it nor endorsing it.
11. Just to understand that if we pusue Pleasure then there wil be Pain. Pain is the shadow of Pleasure, both cannot be separated even though we try to escape Pain by pursuing Pleasure.
#### Desire
12. Why we do Noble or ignoble things in the pursuit of Pleasure? What is this Pleasure?
13. Pleasure comes into being through Four Stages:
    1. Perception: Seeing or Perceivng the Car
    2. Sensation: Reaction comes from Perception of Car
    3. Contact: Touching or Imagining to touch the Car
    4. Desire: Wating to own the car 
14. Or observing something like lovely Cloud, Moutain against sky, leaf that come in Springtime, Deep Valley Full of loveliness and Splendor, Glorious Sunset, Beuatiful non self-conscious face etc..with intense Delight filled with sheer love. Forgetting all the problems, anxieties, and miseries

#### Perversion of Mind/Thought:
15. One can see with Delight and Forget, When the Mind steps in the problem arises:
    1. Mind thinks over what it has seen
    2. thinks how beuatiful it was
    3. Tells you to see it again and again
    4. Tells you to compare it.
    5. Wants to sustain the moment of delight given for a second.
16. The Same goes with Sexual desire, the mind turns the moment of deligh to the Pleasure to pursuit.
17. But the more you repeat the Delight, the more mechanical it becomes.
18. The more you think, the more strength you give to pleasure.
19. The Thought or Mind turns the moment of delight into pursuit of pleasure.

*“Thought wants to repeat the experience, and the more you repeat, the more mechanical it becomes; the more you think about it, the more strength thought gives to pleasure. So thought creates and sustains pleasure through desire and gives it continuity, and therefore the natural reaction of desire to any beautiful thing is perverted by thought. Thought turns it into a memory, and memory is then nourished by thinking about it over and over again.”* - J. Krishnamurti

(*“Thought doesn’t exist, where love is.”*  - J.Krishnamurti, Youtibe video)

#### Memory:
1. The Human Functions upon the memory, but the state of mind which has real Freedom has little place for memory.
2. When we respond to something with our total heart, there is very little memory. 
3. When you don’t repond to a challenge with your whole heart there is conflict, struggle, confusion, pain or pleasure. This struggles registers as Memory and the memory is added to all other memories. And next time you face the challenge all those memories will respond.
4. Anything that is result of memory is old and never free. 
5. Thought it never new, as it results from Memory or Experience.
6. Without thought, a person savours the delight of the moment, it is the thought that tranforms the delight into pleasure, such that the person start comparing, measuring etc..As Pleasure leads to more thinking and escaping from Pain.

*“Thought is never new, for thought is the response of memory, experience, knowledge. Thought, because it is old, makes this thing which you have looked at with delight and felt tremendously for the moment, old. From the old you derive pleasure, never from the new. There is no time in the new.”*  - J. Krishnamurti.

7. Example: You are watching a Movie, cherishing the delight of that moment, suddenly a thought comes, if you don’t have money you were unable to watch movies, another thought comes if you have more money you can watch movies in theatre. The moment of Delight is transformed into pleasure.
8. The moment you look at the world and cherish the moment of delight without letting thought to creep in, you will be having no pain, no fear, and tremendous Joy.

*“So if you can look at all things without allowing pleasure to creep in - at a face, a bird, the colour of a sari, the beauty of a sheet of water shimmering in the sun, or anything that gives delight - if you can look at it without wanting the experience to be repeated, then there will be no pain, no fear, and therefore tremendous joy.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

9. The pursuit of same delight to be repeated is what turns the delight into Pleasure, this Plesaure has a shadow of pain. The moment you couldn’t reach Pleasure you will be pushed to Pain.
10. The moment your pleasure(drinking, sex, smoking, faith, ideology etc..) is snatched, you become angry, anxious, hateful and envious; all this is the manifestation of fear; Fear of not getting what you want and losing what you have. Ultimately in the absence of Pleasure you will be search of new pleasure (drinking, sex, snoking, faith, ideology etc..)

*“Have you noticed when you have been denied the pleasure of drinking or smoking or sex or whatever it is - have you noticed what battles you go through? And all that is form of fear, isn’t it? You are afraid of not getting what you want or of losing what you have.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

11. All this seems so simple, as it is so simple we refuse to see its simplicity.
12. We liekk to complicate everything.
13. If you understand where there is pleasure there is pain, you can live that way by not slipping into pleasure.
14. Or you can end the pleasure which is end the apin by being attentive to it (not like how monks or sanyasis do which is by treating it as Sin, in the process destroying the vitality of their understanding).
15. Such a way through complete understanding of Pleaure you attain Joy.
16. Joy is immediate thing, the moment you think of Joy it turns into Pain which attracts the Pleasure.

*“You cannot think about joy. Joy is an immediate thing, and by thinking about it you turn it into pleasure. Living in the present is the instant perception of beauty and the great delight in it without seeking pleasure from it.”*  - J. Krishnamurti


### Chapter 4: Self Concern (Craving for Position, Fears and Total Fear - Fragmentation of Thoughts - Ending of Fear)
1. What is our Ultimate Interest in Life? 
2. For most of us, isn’t it ourself? 
3. But some argue, it is wrong to have self-interest as primary interest. But what’s wrong in it actually, it is just that one don’t admit it.

*“…there it is - one fundamentally interested in oneself, and for various ideaological or traditional reasons one thinks it is wrong. But what one thinks is irrelevant. Why introduce the factor of its being wrong? That is an idea, a concept. What is fact is that one is fundamentally and lastingly intrested in oneself.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

4. When we say, it is more satisfactory to help others, we need to understand that we are looking for mere satisfaction. Like how we look for satisfaction in sex, food and comforts.
5. So ultimately all we are looking is for satisfaction where there is no dissatisfaction at all.

#### Craving for Postion
6. Most of us crave the satisfaction of having a position in society, as the Society is constructed in was that respects the people in position and kicks the one who didn’t have any postion.
7. The Position could be anythint, the only quality it should have is being recognised by others.
8. It doesn’t matter if there’s inner misery, all it matters is, beings regarded as great outwardly, in this Most find satisfaction.
9. Utlimately one wants to dominate others, this dominating attiutde comes from aggresion and the aggression inturn comes from Fear.

#### Fears:
1. A mind that is caught in fear lives in confusion, in conflict, and therefore must be violent, distorted and aggressive.
2. Such mind cannot move away from its won pattern of thinking.
3. Until we are free from fear we will always remain in darkness.
4. WIth Competitive Education we receive which engenders Fear, and with this corrupt Society, we are all burdened with fear of something or otjer.
5. This fear will wrap, twists and dull our days.
6. There are two types of fears Physical and Psychological, the physical one is a primitive response we inherited as animals, Pyschological one is deep rooted which need our immediate attention.
7. There’s no Fear in Abstraction(exist independently without associate or attributes), Fear lawyas exist in relative (could be job, status, position, comaparison, opinions etc..)
8. Usually we don’t want to confront these fears and run away from it, in turn creating more fears.
9. If the mind tries to suppress the fear, tries to overcome it, discipline it, control it, translate it into something else, there exists conflict and that conflict is a waste of energy.
10. What is Fear?
11. Not what you are afraid of, instead ask yourself what is fear?
12. Our Brain is designed in such a way that, it always make sure that whatever we do is algned with the preconceived pattern, so it could be certain of what comes of next.
13. If the Brain is not certain of comes, or if something goes out of pattern then this uncertainity is regestered as FEAR.

*“The movement from certainty to uncertainty is what I call fear.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

14. We sit without any trouble, but our mind creates the imaginary trouble either from the past or from Future.
15. Now don’t judge, justify, condemn or supress your Fear, instead just look at that fear without the word(or reason) that causes fear.
16. If the Word or reason or memory that is causing you fear then that is not fear at all. 

*“If it is the word or the memory which is causing you fear, then it is not fear at all.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

17. It is always the thought or memory that cause Fear, the reality is far from that thought or memory, in that sense Fear engendered by thought is not real too.
18. Is Fear always the result of thought? If it is then the Fear is old and dead past, like a thought when recognised becomes dead past. The moment you confront the thought, you understand the thought is not real so as fear.

*“So what we are afraid of is the repetition of the old-the thought of what has been projectign into the future. Therefore thought is responsible for fear. This is so, you can see it yourself. When you are confronted with something immediately, there is no fear. It is only when thought comes in that there is fear.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

19. Now the Question is can we live in the moment, in the present? Thoughtless? And be free from Fear?
20. It is only by understanding the Structure of Thought actually, not just intellectually, one gets free from Fear.
21. Thought like Memory is neccessary for Daily Livign, it helps in communicating with others, working at jobs, creativity etc..
22. Thought is the response of memory accumulated through experience, This whole process of geenrating thought from memory of experience is thinking.
23. Thoughts at certain levels are neccessary and helpful in navigatign and progressing through daily life.
24. But the Thoughts that are projected as Future or Past, have the tendency to arise Fear or Pleasure, making the mind dull and ultimately leading to inaction.
25. So why to think about Future or Past in terms of Pleasure or Pain? Isn’t is psychologically possible for Thought to stop.
26. One of main qualities of Thought is to preoccupy ourselves, such that we can stay ignorant from seeing ourselves because we are afrain to look at our fears.

*“One of the functions of thought is to be occupied all the time with something. most of us want to have our minds continually occupied so that we are prevented from seeing ourselves as we actually are. We are afraid to be empty. We are afraid to look at our fear.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

27. We can be aware of fear conciously but are we aware of it in deeper levels of our mind?
28. Does fear can be divided in to different types like conscious or subconscious or all the types are nothing but different forms of same Fear.
29. If all the desires are different forms of same desire, then all fears too are the different forms of same fear.
30. Can we look at this moment of Fear, not the destination, just of moment of Fear into different forms?

#### Total Fear and Fragmentation of Thoughts:
1. All Fears are different forms of one Total Fear.
2. When every opinion we have, every observation we do is the fragmentation of thought, then how can we observe this Total Fear without fragmentation.
3. So, when the Thought is not moving, fragmenting from one form to other, only then we can see this total Fear

*“The whole process of the machinery of thinking is to break up everything into fragments: I love you and I hate you; you are mt enemy, you are my friend; my peculiar idiosyncracies and inclinations, my job, my position, my prestige, my wife, my child, my country and your country, my God and your God - all that is fragmentation of thought. And this thought looks at the total state of fear, or tries to look at it, and reduces it to fragments. Therefore we see that the mind can look at this total fear only when there is no movement of thought.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

4. You can watch Fear only when there is no intereference of past or thought.
5. Only when your mind is quiet, you can watch Fear, if you are tying to control it or get rid of it then all you are doing is escaping from fear.

*“You can watch(fear) only when the mind is very quiet, just as you can listen to what someone is saying only when your mind is not chattering with itself, carrying on a dialogue with itself about its own problems and anxieties…When you say, ‘I must control it(fear), i must get rid of it, I must understand it,’ you are trying to esacpe it.”*  - J, Krishnamurti

6. It is easier to look sky, tree, animals etc.. because they are not vey important, But to look into onselves is more difficult as you come to contact with fear, or despair, lonliness or jealousy, or any other ugly state of mind. 
7. If we try to look the deatails of fear, try to deal with it on eby one, then we alltogether forget to learn live with fear.

*“Can the mind perceive fear and not the different forms of fear - perceive total fear, not what you are afraid of? If you look merely at the details of fear or try to deal with your fears one by one, you will never come to the central issue which is learn to live with fear.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

8. To lvie with a livign thing such as fear, requires a mind and heart that are extraordinarily subtle, having no conclusions they just follow fear. 
9. If you observe and live with it, you can question yourself Who is the observer. Is it the dead entity or living thing.

*“Are you, the observer, a dead entitiy watching a living thing, or are you a living thing watching a livign thing? Because in the observer the two states exist.”* - J. Krishnamurti

10. Observer don’t want fear, they try to subdue it or escape it, there is a constant battle between the observer and fear which is waste of energy.
11. By watching we can learn that the observer is the mere bundle of ideas and memories, but the Fear is the actuality it is real. 
12. Infact it is the reverse, the Fear gives actuality to the Observer.
13. When you realise that observer is the Fea, the effort to stop fear will be ceased. As the observer is Fear there is no point to stop Fear, because it exists neverthless. And then the fear comes totally to an end.

*“As you watch , you learnt that the observer is merely a bundle of ideas and memories without any validity or substance, but that fear is an actuality and that you are tryinng to understand a fact with an abstraction, which of course you cannot do. But, in fact, is the observer who says, ‘I am afraid,’ any different from the thing observed whic is fear?”* - J. Krishnamurti

*“The observer is fear, and when that is realised there is no longer any dissipation of energy in the effort to get rid of fear, and the time-space interval between the observer and the observed dissapears. When you see that you are a part of fear, not separate from it - that you are fear - then you cannot do anything about it; then fear comes totally to an end.*” - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 6: Violence (Anger - Justification and Condemnation - The Ideal and the Actual)
#### Anger:
1. Fear, Pleasure, Sorrow, Thought and Violence are all interrelated.
2. Most of us take pleasure in disliking somebody, hating a particular race or group of people, having antagonistic feelings towards others.
3. But when all violence comes to an end, there’s Joy, which is different from Pleasure of Violence.
4. Can we go to very root of violence and be free from it? 
5. Let us see if we can end all the violence in ourselves and still live in this monstrously brutal wrold.
6. It might be possible to live without breath of hate, jealousy, anxiety or fear.
7. What to do? To live at peace with myself and with the world.
8. If we know how to look at violence both outward and inward then we can go beyond violence.
9. This Violence is ingrained in Man time immemorial, so we need to deal this seriously not just for intelectual entertainment.
10. You might fall into cynicism when don't see the meaning in dealing violence when no one else is serious about it .
11. But if you are really concerned about the violence, You wouldn't beat around the bush saying that world is not serious and all. 
12. You would attempt to cease the violence, wherever you can cease it, and that starts from ceasing violence in you.
13. What is important is not being brother's keeper, but being real.

*“I myself as a human being feel very strongly about this question of violene, and I will see to it that in myself I am not violent - but I cannot tell you or anybody else, ‘Don’t be violent.’It has no meaning - unless you yourself want it.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

14. You may ask yourself that you might be free of Violence but how to live in the World filled with Violence
15. If you are asking such question, then it indicates that you are not living peacefully.
16. You may be imprisoned or get shot, but you will have no problem with that if you are living peacefully.
17. We trying to understand violence as a fact, not as an idea.
18. So to go into that fact you must be completely open to your self. At the same time you have a state of mind to see through it till the end, without any interruption or stops.
19. Now as you can see violence in you, you next need to understand the whole problem of violence, not just a fragment expressed in war or fight, but also as whole which also exists in every animals in different forms like hatred, creating enimity, violence, jealousy, in sexual thoughts etc..
20. There is a deeper layer for Violence.
21. When you try to identify yourself as something, then you are separatign yuorself from everything else, which breeds more violence. So if you want to understand Violence, you need to deal with whole of mankind.

*“When you call yourself an Indian or a Muslim or a Christian or a European, or anything else you are being violent. Do you see why it is violent? Because you are separating yourself from the rest of mankind. When you separate yourself by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds violence. So a man who is seeking to understand violence does not belong to any country, to any religion, to any political party or partial system; he is concerned with the total understanding of mankind.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Justification and Condemnation:
22. There are many theories showing the reasons for us being violent, but all we are concerned is about the fact we are violent.
23. We usually tend to attach the lables righteous anger and unrighteous anger that generates as an expresson of Violence. But in reality there’s no righteous or unrighteous anger, there is only anger. When something is influencing you not in the way you wanted it to influece you, then it is a Bad Inflluence. It is your subjective opinion that descides good or bad influence.
24. Can you look at anger, without labelling it or jusding it, can you look at anger without condemning it or denfending it? Can you look anger as anger?
25. Can you look this phenomenon of anger wihout any reaction to it?
26. When the violence in you is causing a lot of distress in you and in the world, then the question of why you are violent and how it is produced becomes less impaortant when compared to the question of whether it can be stopped. 
27. The moment you look into the question of stopping violence, and tried to understand it, there comes a tremendous vitality and passion to find out.

*“I am not concerned with whether I have inherited this violence or whether society has produced it in me; all I am concerned with is whether it is at all possible to be free from it. To be free from violence means everything to me. It is more important to me than sex, food, position, for this thing is corrupting me. It is destriying me and destroying the world, and I want to understand it,  I want to be beyond it.”*  - J. Krishnamurti 

*“I feel responsible for all this anger and violence in the world. I feel responsible - it isn’t just a lot of words and I say to myself, ‘I can do something only if I am beyond anger myself, beyond violence, beyond nationality.’ And this feeling I have that I must understand the violence in myself brings tremendous vitaltiy and passion to find out.”* - J. Krishnamurti


28. For looking beyond violence, you shouldn’t justify it or condemn it, we have to look at it, study it and become very intimate with it.
29. Can you see how the Violence is destroying you and the world? Or are you looking it as an abstraction of independent existence doing nothing to anyone?
30. If you are concerned about, then take charge to look into it, attend with all your heart and mind to find it.
31. You need to learn how to look at anger, how to look at every individual. You have to learn why you are not objective, why you condemn or justidy anger.
32. We justify or condemn because of our conditioning of the Social Structure we live in. That social structure blunts our mind, but to learn or discover something fundamental, our mind should be sharp, as if to cut through all the social conditoning.

*“You have to learn that you condemn and justify because it is part of the social structure you live in, your conditioning as a German or an Indian or a Negro or an American or whatever you happen to have been born, with all the dulling of the mind that this conditioning results in.”*  - K. Krishnamurti

*“To learn, to discover something fundamental, you must have the capacity to go deeply. If you have a blunt instrument, a dull instrument, you cannot go deeply. So what we doing is sharpening the instrument, which is the mind - the mind which has been made dull by all this justifying and condemning. You can penetrate deeply only if your mind is as sharpt as a needle and as strong as a diamond.”*  - J.Krishnamurti

33. To look at that fundamentak aspect of Anger, you shouldn’t just sit back and keep asking how to get it.
34. Instead you have to go for it, like it is your next meal and see what’s making your mind dull and dull; that’s hindering you from penetration.
35. If you get rid of that hinderance, then you can look at the fundamental aspect of anger in your mind, or perhaps come to a state that is totally aware of whole problem.

#### The Ideal and the Actual:
36. Can we eradicate this Violence?
37. Is it possible for a human being living psychologically in any society to clear violence from himself inwardly? If it is possible then it creates a different world all-together.
38. Through Analysis either by Self or Professional, you might reach an outcome where you become little calmer, but not get the whole perception of anger as in analysis you see in bits and pieces.
39. But the process of anyalsis is what it is important, that brings attentiveness, seriousness and more sharpness in you to have a better clarity at seeing the anger.
40. By seeing yourself, your anger, your daily frustrations, wihthout judgement you get more clearer idea of your anger, then JUMP to see it as whole.

*“I must know how to analyse, which means that in the process of anlaysis my mind becomes extraordinarliy sharp, and it is that quality of sharpness, of attention, of seriousness, which will give total perception. Once hasn’t the eyes to see the whole thing at a glance; this clarity of the eye is possible only if one can see the details, then jump.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

41. We create ideals like Non-Violence to get rid of the fact of Violence. In reality we cannot.
42. We can see all the history is filled with ideals and yet we are still violent.
43. So we need to deal with Violence not non-violence. We need to deal with the Actual
44. To understand the Actual we need to dedicate our whole attention, our whole energy to it.
45. The Ideal we create inturn creates fictious world in our mind and distract our attention and energy.
46. The Man who is really serious do not see the world through the lens of Ideal, he sees the world as it is.

*“The man who is really serious, with the urge to find our what truth is, what love is, has no concept at all. He lives only in what is.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

47. To investigate the fact of your own anger, you shouldn’t judge it.
48. Usually we we bring up the opposite of anger and try to live by it, where the anger is the reality not the opposit.
49. So, we need to observe the fact as is, without any judgement, only then the fact dissapears.

*“When you say you dislike or hate someone, that is a fact although it sounds terrible. If you look at it, go into it completely, it ceases, but if you say. ‘I must not hate; I must have love in my heart’, then you are livign in a hypocritical world with double standards.”*  - J Krishnamurti

*“To live completely, fully, in the moment is to live with what is, the actual, without any sense of condemnation or justification. Then you understand it so totally that you are finished with it. When you see clearly, the problem is solved.”* - J. Krishnamurti

50. Now the QUestion can you see the face of the violence clearly? By gettign rid of the lens of ideology? This requires deep meditation.
51. We need to uderstand that our conditioned mind, the way we live, the whole structure of society prevent us from looking at fact and being entirely free from it. 
52. MOst of times, we say We will consider or We will Try, but this is euqal to not doing, because there are only two polar choices, either we do it or don’t.

*“Your conditioned mind, your way of life, the whole structure of the society in which you live, prevent you from looking at a fact and being entirely free from it immediately. You say ‘I will think about it…I will try to be free.’ That is one of the most dreadful statements you can make: ‘I will try’. There is no trying, no doing your best. Either you do it or you don’t do it.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

*“You are admitting time while the house is burning. The house is burning as a result of the violence throughout the world and in yourself, and you say, ‘Let me think about it. Which ideology is best to put out the fire?’ When the house is on fire, do you argue about the colour of the hair of the amn who brings the water?”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 7: Relationship (-Conflit-Society-Poverty-Drugs-Dependence-Comparison-Desire-Ideals-Hypocrisy)
#### Conflict:
1. Cessation of Violence does not mean, the mind is at peace with itself and in all its relationships.
2. Usually we tend to form the image of the person we come in contact to, the moment the image is formed then the realtionship ends between the two persons and there will be realtionship between the images.
3. The image of Wife will have relationship with image of Husband.
4. When realtionsship exists between images then obviously there wouldn’t be peace, because images are fictious they are not real.
5. And yet this is what all are doing, forming images, ideas, symbols in themselves and livign by it, not by the reality. (stereotypes and prejudices happen at every level and in every contact, it is just that we name only few)

*“And yet that is what we are all doing: living in ideas, in theories, in symbols, in images which we have created about ourselves and others and which are not realities at all. All our relationships, whether they be with property, ideas or people, are based essentially on this image-forming, and hence there is always conflcit.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

6. Is it possibe to be completely at peace within ourselves and in our relationships?
7. Life is a movement in relationship, and if this realtionship is based on an abstraction, an idea, or a specualtive assumption, then such abstractive living will inevitably bring about the relationship which is a battefield.
8. So can a person live a inward lfie without confniing themselves within ideas, live with inward tranquility, which knows no disturbance at any moment? Not in any mythical or abstract world by in reality in daily?

#### Society:
9. This is a serious question as every aspect of our consciousness is touched by conflict.
10. In our every realtionship either with person or idea or society there exists a duality and a conflict.
11. Usually a person accepts conflict to be innate part of life and greed, jealousy, aquisitiveness and aggression as natural way of living.
12. When a Person accepts such, then it indicates that they are trying to fit in the hold of respectability.
13. As long as they strive for respectability and try to fit into the pattern of society, they constantly lives in a Battlefield.
14. It is the person who removes the shackles of respectability will  be free from the pyshcological structure of society

*“When we examine our own minds and hearts, thw way we think, the way we feel and how we act in our daily lives, we observe that as long as we conform to the pattern of society, life must be a battlefield. If we do not accept it - and no religious person can possibly acccept such a society - then we will be completely free from the psychological structure of society.”* - J. Krishnamurti

#### Poverty:
15. We are abundant with the things of Society that are greed, envy, anger, hate, jealousy and anxiety.
16. Even those who took monkhood, are having the things like religion, tradition, or position.
17. One should be in Poverty to be completely in free of the things of Society.
18. It is only when we become inwardly poor, we can see the truth of life in which there is no conflict at all.

*“One must become poor inwardly, for then there is no seeking, no asking, no desire, no - nothing! It is only this inward poverty that can see the truth of a life in which there is no conflict at all.”*  - J. Krishnamurti 

19. How is it possible to free useleves from this struture of society? In turn freeing ourselves from the conflict?
20. Yes we can isolate ourselves or trim the aspects of conflict, but can we live in inward and outward tranquility without isolating ourselves? 
21. Where instead of vegetating or stagnating ourselves, we becomes more dynamic, vital and full of energy.

#### Drugs:
16. To be really free of any problem, we need a great deal of Passionate energy
17. Not just intellectua and physical energy, but an energy that isn’t dependent on any motive, any pyscological stimulus or drug.
18. When the energy is drug induced, that very drug keeps us bounded, 
19. So all drugs (religion, motivation, speeches) will keep us bounded and inevitably bring about dependence. 
20. This dependence prevents us from seeing things clearly.

*“By taking some form of drug we may find enough energy temporarily to see things very clearly, but we revert to our former state and therefore become dependent on that drug more and more. So all stimulation, whether of the church or of alcohol or of drugs or of the written or spoken word, will inevitably bring about dependence, and that dependence prevetns us from seeing clearly for ourselves and therefore from having vital energy”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Dependence:
21. Why we are dependent on drugs? Why do we depend on anything Psychologicaly at all? 
22. If we Question, We will discover the answer and that answer will give you vitality.
23. For everyone there will be this or that to depend upon, Why? Is it because they are shallow form inside? Is it because they have no source which is always full and rich, vital and moving?
24. Yes, you found the cause, would that make you free from Dependance? You accepted it intellectually and has an aquiescience in some ideology, even then you don’t escape dependance
25. The only way to escape dependance is to see it as whole, how it makes your mind stupid, dull and inactive.

*“The mere intellectual acceptance in an ideology cannot free the mind from being dependent on something which will give it stimulation. What frees the mind from dependence is seeing the whole structure and nature of stimulation and dependence and how that dependence makes the mind stupid, dull, and inactive. Seeing the totality of it alone frees the mind.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

26. But if you are attmepting to see the totality through your knowledge, then you are seeing through the lens of knowledge. 
27. It is only when Thought does not interfere, you can see the Totality of something.
28. When you se e it, actually what it is, without any like or dislike, you observe it, then thre is Whole Picture you can see, when Mind sees the whole picture there is freedom.

*“I have discovered intellectually, verbally, through analysis, the cause of my dependence, but whatever thought investigates must inevitably be fragmentary. So  I can see the totality of something only when thought does not interfere.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

29. One may think that by accepting a authority, a priest, ritual or the dogma or an ideology there is no waste of energy
30. But whatever we chose as authority is fragmentary, therefore cause conflict. As there will always be a comparison between What is and What should be

*“…but the following and acceptance of an ideology. Whether it is good or bad, whether it is holy or unholy, is a fragmentary activity and therefore a cause of conflict. And conflict will inevitably arise so long as there is a division between what should be and what is, and any conflcit is a dissipation of energy.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

31. Asking how to get yourself free from this conflcit creates another conflict, instead observe the conflict like any other concrete object, you will then understand the truth in which there is no conflcit.

*“If you put the question to yourself, ‘How am I to be free from conflict? you are creating another problem, and hence you are increasing the conflict, whereas if you just see it as a fact - see it as you would see some concrete object - clearly, directly - then you will understand essentially the turth of life in which there is no conflcit at all.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Comparison:
32. We are always comapring What we are with What we should be; in this comparison there is conflict. Only when we stop this comparison, we can see What is.
33. When you can see What is; then you can give your whole attention to it, It could be your desire, despair, ignorance, anxiety etc..and live with it completely, then there is no contradiction and hence no conflict.

*“Contradiction exists when there is comparison, not only with something or somebody, but with what you were yesterday, and hence there is conflict between what has been and what it. There is what is only when there is no comparison at all, and to live with what is is to be peaceful. Then you can give your whole attention without any distraction to what is within yourself - whether it be despair, ugliness, brutality, fear, anxiety, loneliness - and live with it completely, then there is no contradiction and hence no conflict.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

*“…all the time we are comparing ourselves with those who are richer or more brilliant, more intellectual, more affectionate, more famous, more this and more that…this measuring ourselves all the time against something or someone is one of the primary causes of conflict.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

34. But the thing is we are conditioned(in all out childhood, through upbringing) to measure ouselves with something or smoething more (rich, intellect, brilliat, affectionate, famous, etc..)
35. The moment we stop comparing is the moment we will be What we are
36. If we try to evolve through comparison, to become more intelligent, more beautiful etc.., we are just fragmenting our own selves. Which is waste of energy
37. But to see what you are, without any comparison, gives you tremendous energy to look, whe you look at yourself without comparison, you basically sees how mind wastes energy on comparison.

*“To see what you actually are without any comparison gives you tremendous energy to look. When you can look at yourself without comparison, you are beyond comparison, which does not mean that the mind is stagnant with contentment. So we see in essence how the mind wastes energy which is so necessary to understand the totality of life.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Desire:
1. With whom we are in conflict is not relevant, what’s relevant is why we are in conflict.
2. If you dig deeper, you will get to realise that Conflict is nothing but misunderstood Desire.
3. We can see that Desire is contradictory; not the objects of Desire but the Desire itself is contradictory.
4. Being contradictory doesn’t mean you have to suppress your desires, instead you have to observe that the desires are contradictory

*“Desire is always in contradiction I desire contradictory things - which doesn’t mean that I must destroy desire, suppress, control or sublimate it - I simply see that desire itself is contradictory. it is not the objects of desire but the very nature of desire which is contradictory.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Ideal:
1. If deaire is the root of all contradiction, this desire contains the nature of duality; Wanting Pleasure and not wanting Pain.
2. Why there is this inward psychological duality?
3. Is it because we are always brought up; to compare What is with What Should be?
4. We are conditioned that thinking of opposite will bring get rid of what is?
5. Or is it years of propaganda that one must have an ideal the opposite of what is in order to cope with the present.

*“Why do we have this pyschological duality? is it that we have been brought up always to comapre what is with what should be?..Has this duality come in to being becayse we believe that thinking about the opposite of violence, the opposite of envy,,, of jealousy, of meanness, will help us to get rid of those things?…Or is it because you have been told by thousands of years of propaganda that you must have an ideal - the opposite of what is - in order to cope with the present?*

#### Hypocrisy:
1. All this while you have been conditioned to have an Ideal that tells you What you shoudl be, but at same time What you are is unlike your ideal.

*“You have a concept of what you should be and how you should act, and all the time you are in fact acting quite differently; so you see that principles, beliefs, and ideals must inevitably lead to hypocrisy and a dishonest life.”*  - J. Krishnmurti

2. It is the ideal that creates What should for What is; if you know how to live with What is; then the opposite for it not necessary.
3. Trying to become like somebody else or like your ideal, creates confusion within you; any action taken with confusion leads to further confusion. So you cease to act in terms of confusion. The Inaction is the right action.

*“Trying to become like somebody else, or like your ideal, is one of the main causes of contradiction, confusion, and conflict. A mind that is confused, whatever it does, at any level, will remain confused, any action born of confusion leads to further confusion. I see thus very clearly, I see it as clearly as I see an immediate physical danger. So what happens? I cease to act in terms of confusion anymore. Therefore inaction is complete action.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter8: Freedom (-Revolt-Solitude-Innocence-Livign with Ourselves as We are)
#### Revolt:
1. No agonies of suppresion, no brutal discipline of confirming to a pattern has led to truth.
2. To come upon the truth the mind must be completely free, without a spot of distortion.
3. But the question is are we willing to to be free?
4. We want to be free from unpleasant and painful things, but do we want to be free from pleasurable things?
5. If you say you want to be free, then we must understand the nature and structure of freedom.
6. But by saying we want to be free from something, we are being bound to the freedom itself.

*“If you say you are free from something, it is a reaction which will then become another reaction which will bring about another conformity, another form of domination, In this way you can have a chain of reactions and accept each reaction as freedom. But it is not freedom; it is merely a continuity of a modified past which the mind clings to.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

7. Every Youth of every time are in revolt against the society, though it is good in a way, it is not Freedom.
8. The revolt, eventually leads to the same pattern, which required another revolt.
9. Freedom comes from seeing and acting, never through revolt, seeing is acting and such action is instantaneous as you see a Danger.
10. When there is Danger, you don’t think or discuss or hessitate, you see and act, this see and acting is Freedom.

#### Solitude:
1. Freedom is a state of mind, it is not being free from something.
2. Freedom can only be sensed, it allows you to doubt and question everything, being so intense, active and vigorous, it throws away every form of dependence, slavery, confirmity, and acceptance.
3. Such freedom implies being completely alone, remaining in solitude.
4. But in this society where we are conditioned to depend on something or someone, can we find the freedom which is complete solitude? Without any leadership? tradition? and authority?
5. Solitude is an inward state of mind, that doesn’t depend on any external factor.
6. Being isolated, depends on staying away from people and building a wall around us.
7. But being Alone or isolated, has nothing to do with extranalities.

#### Innocence
8. The Person who is alone is free from thoughts, their mind is clear of rubbish it has accumulated, thier past is dead, they don’t belong to any group(family, country, culture etc…)
9. They are alone and innocent, from that innocence there mind gets free from sorrow.
10. To abandon all the baggage we accumulate from opinions, memories, thoughts, judgements etc..is to be alone, a mind that is alone is not just innocent but young and alive.
11. Only the Mind of Solitude can see the Truth.

*“We carry about with us the burden of what thousands of people have said and the memories of all our misfortunes. To abandon all that totally is to be alone, and the mind that is alone is not only innocent but young - not in time or age, but young, innocent, alive at whatever age - and only such a mind can see that which is truth and that whcih is not measurable by words.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Livign with Ourselves as we are:
12. In this solitude, you will understand living with yourself, not how should be or how you were once.
13. See if you can look at yourself without tremor or fear or justification or condemnation and live with yourself as you actually are.
14. When you live something, you will understand, but if you get used to it, you will not live it.
15. Such a way, we need to live with our envy, jealousy, anxiety, never get used to it or accept it, but to live with it, care it, and love it.

*“So can. you- can you and I- live with what we actually are, knowling ourselves to be dull, envious, fearful, believing we have tremendous affection when we have not; getting easily hurt, easily flattered, and bored - can we live with all that, neither accepting it nor denying it, but just observing it without becoming morbid, depressed or elated?”*  - J. Krishnamurti

16. Is this knowing yourselves and livign with ourselves is matter of time something that is done gradually? Absolutey not? By thinking so we are enslaving ourselves to time? this isn’t a skill to improve gradually, this is the Turht that has no time.
17. Can we become consious of Freedom? If a person says “I am happ” it indicates that they are happy of thinking something that is already ast gone. it is not present or real. Such a way freedom too.
18. When you look at life without bondage of time, the Freedom comes on its won naturally. 

*“Freedom can only come about naturally, not through wishing, wanting, longing. Not will you find it by creating an image of what you think it is. To come upon it the mind has to learn to look at life, which is a vast movement without bondage of time, for freedom lies beyond the field of consciousness.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 9: Time(-Sorrow-Death)
1. Man lives by time, inventing the Future has been his favourite game of escape.
2. We are conditioned to think that time brings peace, but time doesn’t bring peace, there is no tomorrow for us to be peaceful. We need to be peaceful now.
3. Time vanishes the moment we see dange, then all time becomes immediate. 
4. Time is a mere deception, a Man’s creation where he made further divisions of past, present and future. 
5. As long as a Man divides time, they will always be in conflict.

*“When there is real danger time disappears, doesn’t it? There is immediate action. But we do not see the danger of many of our problems, and therefore we invent time as a means of overcoming them. TIme is a deceiver as it doesn’t do a thing to help us bring about a change in ourselves. Time is a movement which man has divided into past, present, and future, and as long as he divides it he will always be in conflict.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

6. If one lears through time, we should have learnt after all these thousands of years, a better way to live without hating and killing each other.
7. To resolve this life that we made monstrous and meaningless, we need to understand the problem of time.
8. We can look at time, only through freshness and innocence, like how you stop and look around when you los tin woods, same way, the ones that are lost in life will pause and look innwardly, making mind peaceful and clear.

#### Sorrow:
9. We meet a issue incompletley only in Time, and this incomplete understanding causes Problem.
10. Till one gives completel attention, the problem doesn’t solve. By saying we hope to solve it one of these days, we just prolong the problem
11. We always live in the interval between the IDEA and ACTION
12. Idea is for self-protectiion, idea keeps us secure from our reality.
13. Action, is immediate it drags you to present, but at same time it is uncertain and dangerous.
14. So we become satisfied with Idea rather than taking action.
15. In fact Action is having pressure of approximating to the Idea, which creates conflict.
16. The interval of time in which you Live, which is in between Idea and Action is the Thought.
17. This thought, through the knowledge it gained, furthers more thought, that talk to you and that is TIme. Ex: Tomorrow you will do good, it iwll be good day etc..
18. Can we put a stop to this TIme? Live without thought for tomorrow or anything? This Though or time is sorrow.

*“…that memory remains, and you are thinking about the pleasure and that pain - you are looking back, wishing, hoping, regretting; so thought, going over it agains and again, breeds this thing we call sorrow and gives continuity to time…So long as there is this interval of time which has been bred by thought, there must be sorrow, there must be continuity of fear.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

19. But by asking “Will it ever end?”, we are creating an Idea, which created further thought and time

#### Death:
1. Is it possible to meet Death completely and not make it a problem at all with our premedeated anxiety.
2. We have all our theories with death, like soul, rebith, reincarnation etc..
3. Is Soul an Idea that is passed on? Is there anything permanent? Continuous? Beyond thought?
4. If there is something permanent we can think of, then it is cannot be, as nothing is permanent in the field of thought. 
5. So, there is nothing Permanent.

*“Is there something permanent, continuous, which is beyond thought? If thought can think about it, it is within the field of thought, and therefore it cannot be permanent because there is nothing permanent within the field of thought. To discover that nothing is permanent is of tremendous importance, for only then is the mind free; then you can look, and in that there is great joy.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

6. Death is a mere word, that in turn creates image that in turn generate thought, can we look at death without image? As image creates thoughts, thoughts create further thoughts that act in resistance of inevitable.

*“So can you look at death without the image of death? As long as the image exists, from which springs thought, thought must always create fear. Then you can either rationalise your fear of death and build a resistance agaisnt inevitable, or you invent innumerable beliefs to protect you from the fear of death. Hence there is a gap between you and the thing of which you are afrais. In this time-space interval there must be conflict, which is fear, anxiety, and self-pity.”*  - J. Krishnamurti.

7. This fear is the interval of time we created between Living and Dying
8. Death is mysterious, thogh it is end of misery of lIving, we are afraid of it. As we like to cling to known than unknown.

*“Living is our daily torture, daily insult, sorrow and confusion, with occasional opening of a window over enchanted seas. That is what we call livign, and we are afraid to diem which is to end misery. We would rather cling to the known than face the unknown - the known being our housem our furniture, our family, our character, our work, our knowledge, our fame, pur lonliness, our gods - that little thing that moves around incessanlty within itself wiht its own limited pattern of embittered existence.”*  - J. Krishnamurti.

9. All the while, in the process of escaping and afraiding death, we got used to live with agony, despair.
10. But Dying is needed to Live, We can only live if we die everymoment,
11. There has to be dying, only then we can be living.

*“You cannpt live if you do not die psychologically every monute. This is not an intellectual paradox. To live completely, wholly, every day as if it were a new loveliness, there must be dying to everything of yesterday; otherwise you live mechanically, and a mechanical mind can never know what love is or freedom is.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

12. We are afraid of death, because we don’t know how to live, so we are not sure of how to die too.
13. We you stop fearing life, you stop fearing death, you allow death, you allow love.

*“As long as we are frightened of life, we shall be frightened of death. The man who is not fightened of life is not frightened of being completely insecure, for he understands that inwardly, pyschologically, there is no security.* When there is no security there is an endless movement, and then life and death are the same. The man who lives without conflict, who lives with beauty and love, is not frightenedof death because to love is to die.”  - J. Krishnamurti

14. One need to die to everything they know (fanily, memory and everything) it is only then they can be purified by death.
15. It is only then death is a purification, a rejuvenating process and brings innocence.
16. It is only the innocent that are passionate.
17. It is only when you die, you know what happens after death, dying not physcially, but psychologically, die to the things that are bitter.
18. It is after death there comes mutation, where though tdoes not function at all because thought is old.
19. When there is death, there is something new.
20. Freedom from Known is death, and then you are living.

*“To find out actually what takes place when you die you must die. This isn't a joke. You must die - not physically but psychologically, inwardly, die to the things you have cherished and to the things you are bitter about. If you have died to one of your pleasures, the smallest 103 or the greatest, naturally, without any enforcement or argument, then you will know what it means to die. To die is to have a mind that is completely empty of itself, empty of its daily longings, pleasures and agonies. Death is a renewal, a mutation, in which thought does not function at all because thought is old. When there is death there is something totally new. Freedom from the known is death, and then you are living.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 10: Love
1. The demand ot be safe and secure in a realtionship breeds sorrow and fear and it indicates insecurity.
2. We expect the security of being loved , but do we know how to love? 
3. Is there love in seeking security?

*“Most of us want the security of loving and being loved, but is there love when each one of us is seekign his own security, his own particular path? We are not loved because we don’t know how to love.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

4. What is Love?
   1. World is corrupted with the idea of Love, it inludes love in everything -> loving the countru, book, mouthain, pleasure, wife and God.
   2. If love is an idea; it can be cultivated, nourshed and even manipulated.
   3. If God is a prejction of your Idea, saying I love God has no point, as saying I love I.
5. If Love could be the solution to all problems? How can we even dfind Love?
6. By defining it? there are corpus of definitions already existing for love.
7. As adoring someone, companionship and senusality is considered personal, it is not considered by Love by Church, it believes Love is beyond it.
8. In Human Love when there is Greed, pleasure, envy and all, Church said Love is even beyond it.
9. In this search for beyond, many starved themselves from the sexuality, they even abstained from beauty when it is related to sexuality.
10. So to understand love, we need to come out of these ideas that decide What Love is and What Love should be

*“Can love be divided into the sacred and the profane, the human and the divine, or is there only love? Is love of the one and not of the many? If I say, ‘I love you’, does that exclude the love of the other? Is love personla or impersonal? Moral or immoral? Family or non-familu? If you love mankind, can you love the particular? Is love sentiment? Is love emotion? Is love pleasure and desire?…So to go into the question of what love is, we must free it from the encrustation of centuries, put away all ideals and ideologies of what it should or should not be.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

11. Now not just the ideas of others, you must free yourself from your own inclinations and prejudices of love.

*“i am confused torn by my own desires, so I say to myself, ‘First clear up your own confusion. Perhaps you may be able to discover what love is through what it is not.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

12. Is Love Desire? Most of us consider it be so, desire with pleasure, which in turn derived through senses.
13. Let’s take sex, sex gives you momentary abandonment from yourself and you are back again, so you desire that momentary relief and wants sex again and again.
14. When your Wife is giving you all kinds of emotional satisfaction through sex, through  fulfilling her gender role then you love her, if she got bored and not fulfilling her gender role you hat her. So love happens only when you recieve, hate happens when you don’t receive.

*“So what you are really saying it: ‘As long as you belong to me I love you, but the moment you don’t, I begin to hate you. As long as I can rely on you to satisfy my demands, sexual and otehrwise, I love you, but the moment you cease to supply what I want I don’t like you.’ So there is antagonism between you, there is separation, and when you feel separate from another there is no love.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

15. It is only when there is no conflict within yourself, you will know what love is, as you are struglled between assessing is it love or hate, basically becoming slave to pleasure.

*“But if you can live with your wife without thought creating all these contradictory states, these endless quarells in yourself, then perhaps - perhaps - you will know what love is. Then you are completely free and so is she, whereas if you depend on her for all your pleasure, you are a slave to her. So when one loves there must be freedom, not only from other person but from oneself.”* - J. Krishnamurti

16. When there is dependence on another psychologically, there must always be anxiety, fear, jealousy, guilt.
17. As long as the mind is ridden by fear, there is no love. Love has nothing to do with emotionality, sentimentality, pleasure and desire.
18. Love is not the product of past or future, it is always present, it does not obey, it is neither respect nor disrespect. 
19. When you completely abandon yourself to the Love, there is no other
    1. You know no hate
    2. You know no jealousy
    3. You know no anger
    4. You know no interference
    5. You know no condemning and complaining
    6. You know no comparison (when you love someone with all your heart, there is no comparison)
20. Is there responsibility and duty in Love? If you do out of duty, is there love in it? The structure of duty is confining the Human.
21. When there is Love there is no duty or responsibility.
22. When Parents care for their Children to fit into Society, can we call that Care as Love? To subject the Children to the conflict and brutality.
23. To care is as you would treat a Plant, you water it, study its needs, you provide the best soil, you look after with tenderness and gentleness, but preparing your Children to fit into society is like preparing to killl them.

*“The parents want their children to have a secure position in society. What they call responsibility is part of that respectability they worship; and it seems to me that where there is respectability there is no order; they are concerned only with becoming perfect bourgeoisie, When they prepare their children to fit into society they are perpetuating war, conflict and brutality. Do you call that care and love?…Really to care as you would for a tree or plant, watering it, studying its needs, the best soil for it, looking after it with gentleness and tenderness - but when you prepare your children to fit into society you are preparing them to be killed, If you loved your children you would have no war.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

24. When you lose someone, you shed tears, are those tears for yourself or for the one who is dead?
25. Are you crying becuse a Human is Dead or that you became befreft of the affection you had till then? If it’s the latter case, you are tears have no meaning.
26. If you understand this that the tears are for your loss, which is your thing that is inside you, you can see it fully, completely in one glace (all the ‘MY’ things like tears, family, religion, nation, belief) all that ugliness inside you.
27. When you see it with your heart, not with your mind, then you have key to end sorrows.
28. Sorrow and Love can never go together, but in Christian world they have idealised it and worshipped suffering by putting it on a cross.
29. What is Love then? It may mean complete upheaval, discovering the reality of family, your dependence on your wife, husband or children.
30. Even still you go further finding what love is, you will see:
    1. Love is no Fear
    2. Love is no Dependence
    3. Love is no Possessiveness and Domination
    4. Love is no responsibility and duty
    5. Love is no Self-pity
    6. Love is no opposite of Hate
    7. Only when discovering all these, you will find with one last discovery that is Love
31. Love is needed for Humanity, or the World will go disaster.
32. Who is goign to teach you how to love? As it is needed the most
33. You can practice compassion, gentlenes, and maintain discipline, but Love is not a disciline to maintain. 

*“By practising some method or system of loving you may become extraordinarily clever or more kindly or get into a state of non-violence, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with love.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

34. The world is consumed with the play of pleasure and desir, where there is no Love, and without love there is no meaning for life.
35. At same time, you cannot love when there is no beauty. Beauty is not in the sense of Physcial Attractiveness, but something, where heart and mind can sense the Love.
36. Wihtout Love and Beuaty, whatever you do no matter a great deed, will create more mischief and suffering.

*“In this torn desert world there is no love because pleasure and desire play the greatest roles, yet without love your daily life has no meaning.”* - J. Krishnamurti

*“And you cannot have love if there is no beauty. Beauty is not something you see - not a beuatiful tree, a beautiful picture, a beautiful buildiing or beautiful woman. There is beauty only when your heart and mind know what love is. Without love and that sense of beauty there is no virtue, and you know very well that, do what you will, improve society, feed the poor, you will only be creating more mischef, for without love there is only ugliness and poverty in your own heart and mind. But when there is love and beauty, whatever you do is right, whatever you do is in order. if you know how to love, then you can do what you like because it will solve all other problems.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

37. Can Love come upon without teacher or thought or guide or any external factor?
38. To find Love one has to bring forth Passion without a Motive, a Passionate Mind without seekign anything, a State of complete self-abandonement.
39. The One who is filled with love will be felt everywhere the same way, like a flower that is filled with perfume.

*“A man who does not know what passion is will never know love because love can come into being only when there is total self-abandonment…A mind that is seeking is not a passionate mind and to come upon love without seeking it is the only way to find it..”*  - J. Krishnamurti

40. Love has no yesterday or tomorrow, it has no thought, it is only perceived through the innocent minds who can live in non-innocent world.

*“Love is something that is new, fresh, alive. It has no yesterday and no tomorrow. It is beyong the turmoil of thought. It is only the innocent mind which knows what love is, and the innocent mind can live in the world which is not innocent.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

41. This understanding of Love comes naturally, not through sacrifice, worship, relationship, sex, pleasure and pain.

### Chapter 11: To Look and to Listen - Art - Beauty - Austerity - Images - Problems - Space
#### To Look and to Listen
1. Whatever Love we ecperience, is that really Love?
2. Most of us consider love to be life long emotional satisfaction, isn’t it a mutual gratification and exlploitation? How can that be love?
3. We would discuss all other topics like politics or economics, but when it comes to love, we shy away.

*“We have discovered that for most people love means comfort, security, a guarantee for the rest of their lives of continuous emotional satisfaction….’Is that really love?’…when you are driven into corner to look, you realise that what you have always thought of as love is not love at all; it is a mutual gratification, a mutual exploitation.”*  - J, Krishnamurti

4. Love has no formula, it can be viewed when there is no thought, when there is freedom from condemnation, judgement, agreeding and disagreeing.
5. To Look (or to listen) is one of the most difficult things to do, in this modern world, most of the people whose eyes are blinded by worries are becoming so busy and livign in confined spaces and losing the touch of beauty.

*“If your eyes are blinded with your worries, you cannot see the beauty of the sunset. Most of us have lsot touch with nature. Civilisation is tending more and more towards large cities; we are becoming more and more an urban people, livign in crowded apratments and having very little space even to look at sky of an evening and morning, and therefore we are losing touch with a great deal of beauty.”* - J. Krishnamurti

#### Art:
6. Losing touch with Nature, we are resorting to stimulants like art and entertainment. Through books, movies, museums, modern: mobile, social media, digital media etc..
7. If you could look at the beauty of Nature, why would you even choose or crave for any other entertainment.

*“Having lost touch with nature we naturally tend to develop intellectual capacities. We read a great many books, go to great many museums and concerts, watch television and have many other entertainments…Why is it that we depend so much upon art? Is it a form of escape, of stimulation?”* - J. Krishnamurti 

*“If you are directly in contact with nature; if you watch a movement of a bird on wing, see the beauty of every movement of a bird on the wing, see the beauty of every movement of sky, watch the shadows on the hills or the beauty on the face of another, do you think you will want to go to any museum to look at any picture? Perhaps it is because you do not know how to look at all things about you that you resort to some form of drug to stimulate you to see better.”* - J. Krishnamurti

8. Are we looking at the objective thing like a tree completely or just the image created by the universe of it?
9. Have you ever just saw something, without judging or associating it with something or distorting yourself by taking position of observer, have you just saw something with complete attention?
10. Example: Seeing tree (just to see, not to judege, name or anything else)

#### Beauty:
1. The mind that looks with complete self-abandonment, is what, that can see the Beauty, and the state of seeing this beuaty is Love.
2. When we see something, we take the place of observer or thinker, compare the object and decide its beauty.
3. But can we see the beauty without object?

*“’Is there a beauty without object?’ When there is an observer who is the censor, the experiencer, the thinker, there is not beauty because beauty is something external, something the observer looks at and judges, but when there is no observer - and this demands a great deal of meditation, of enquiry - then there is beauty without the object.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Auterity:
4. The self-abandonment is possible ony when there is total austerity (not htose harsh rules and principles), but the austerity of being completely simple, which is complete humility.
5. This simplicity is just not adding anything additional than what you see.
6. In this humility there is no achieving or no ladder to climb, it is all about every step being first and everlasting step lived with total attention and humility, which is complete in itself.
7. In love there is no observer, one takes position of observer when their love is desire and pleasure. Without desire and pleasure, love is intense. It is like beauty, something new every day.

*“You are surrounded by nature and there is no dog barking, no noise of a car passing or even the flutter of a bird. You are completely silent and nature around you is also wholly silent. In that state of silence both in the observer and the observed - when the observer is not translating what he observes into thought - in that silence there is a different quality of beauty. There is neither nature nor the observer, There is a state of mind wholly, completley, alone; it is alone - not in isolation - alone in stillness is beauty.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

*“When you love, is there an observer? There is an observer only when love is desire and pleasure. When desire and pleasure are not associated with love, then love is intense. It is, like beauty, something totally new everyday. As I have said, it has no yesterday and no tomorrow.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Images:
8. It is only when we see without any preconcenceived notion or image, we are able to be in direct contact with life.
9. Usually, people don’t see each other, instead they see the images they form of each other. That is why there are all these relationship problems.

*“All our relationships are really imaginary - that is, based on an image formed by thought. If i have an image about you and you have an image about me, naturally we don’t see each other at all as we actually are. What we see is the images we have formed about each other which prevent us from being in contact, and that is why our relationships go wrong.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

10. When you say, I know you, It is that you know the yesterday’s image of a person, what a person is now you don’t know. The image is formed by gathering all the memories that have formed till now of that person.
11. Usually two people who lived together for long time, will form images of each other, which prevents from really being in relationship.
12. It is through understanding of relationship, we cooperate, but we can’t cooperate through images, symbols or ideologies.
13. It is only through understandng of true relationship, there can be love. 
14. Therefore one has to understand, not intecllectually but actually, how we built images of various people and elements we lived with.

*“Only when we understand the true relationship between each other is there a possibility of love, and love is denied when we have images. Therefore it is important to understand not intellectually but actually in you daily life, how you have built images…”* - J. Krishnamurti

15. The image we create, in turn create the space between us and what we observe, and in that space there is conflict. 
16. So is it possiblt to free of the space we create? Not only outside ourselves but in ourselves? 
17. Free from the space that we create between the image of other and actually what we see of other? spcae that we create between the image of us that we create and actual us we see?

#### Problems:
1. We become attentive to a problem, you give the energy to that problem.
2. And when you give your complete attention, you give your complete energy to that problem, and in that state there is no observer at all.
3. This state of total attention and total energy is highest form of intelligence.

*“The very attention you give to a problem is the energy that solves that problem. When you give your complete attention - I mean with everything in you- there is no observer at all. There is only the state of attention which is total energy, and that total energy is the highest form of intelligence.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

4. In that state of mind there is complete stillness, not a disciplined stillness, but the total stillness in which there is niether the observer nor the thing observed.

*“Naturally that state of mind be completely silent and that silence, that stillness, comes when there is total attention, not disciplined stillness. That total silence is which, there is neither the obsever nor the thing observed, is the highest form of religious mind. But what takes place in that state cannot be put into words because what is said in words is not the fact. To find out for yourselves you have to go through it.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

5. Every pyschological problem is related to other psychological problem.
6. Resolving one problem completely, irrespective of that problem, we would be able to meet all other problems easily and resolve them.
7. Problem exists only in time and when you are not taking complete action:
   1. Let's say the thought "I have to read"  creates anxiety and becomes a problem
   2. Let's say the thought "I did not read" creates regret and becomes a problem
   3. But the thought "I am reading:" is not a thought itself, it's the action, the complete action.
8. It isn't enough to be aware of nature and structure of problem, one should immediately take charge and resolve it completely such that it does not take root in mind.
9. If one allows the problem to stay in mind even for a while, it distorts the mind,

*“So not only must we be aware of the nature and structure of problem and see it completely, but meet it as it arises and resolve it immediately so that it does not take root in the mind. If one allows a problem to endure for a month or a day, or even for a few minutes, it distorts the mind.”*   - J. Krishnamurti

10. Is it possible to meet the problem immediately? Without any distorition? And be able to free ourselves with that problem without even leaving any memory of it? 
11. The memories we carry are nothing but the images we created.
12. Now when we meet the real life with the images, there comes conflict and contradiction.

*“Life is very real - life is not an abstraction - and when you meet it with images there are problems”*. - J. Krishnamurti

#### Space:
1. Is it possible to meet every issue without this space-time interval? WIthout gap between the reality and the image? Without gap between oneself and that one is afraid?
2. It is possible only when the observer(builder of image, collector of memories and ideas) is not having the continuity.
3. Whatever we look at, it could be stars, wife, children, friends etc..We usually create space in between.
4. Example: Instead of meeting our friend, we meet the image in our mind of our friend, saying “ohh they are great” etc..
5. As we always look with an image, we don’t understand the space that is in between.
6. Except for the moments of self-abandonment, one doesn’t see the space in between without an image. 
7. As long as we keep on creating the space between the observed and observer, there is neither love nor beauty.
8. When there is no space, no centre or circumference then there is love and beauty,

*"You will never understand about the space between yourself and the stars, yourself and your wife or husband, or friend, because you have never looked without the image, and that is why you do not know what beauty is or what love is. You talk about it, you write about it, but you have never known it except perhaps at rare intervals of total self-abandonment. So long as there is a centre creating space around itself there is neither love nor beauty. When there is no centre and no circumference then there is love. And when you love you are beauty."*  - J. Krishnamurti

9. Whenever we are looking at something, we are creating a centre of ourselves and space between us and what we see. 
10. This space is the reason for our lives being so empty and callous.
11. But we cannot cultivate love or beauty, it happens naturally, nor can we invent truth, it is already there.
12. But we can be aware, can be aware that we are creating space. We can cultivate such awareness.
13. Out of this awareness we can see the nature of pleasure, desire and sorrow and the lonliness and boredom of man. And everntually you find out 'the space'.
14. When you see the space between the observed and the observer, then you realise there is no love. 
15. However hard one might try, but untill and unless the space exists and their attempts to change the world becomes futile and gives rise to another form of agony.
16. Example:
    1. Socialists see the image of socialist society; implementing which gave rise to corruption and authoritarianism
    2. Capitalists saw the image of capitalist society; implementing which gave rise to inequality and alienation.
17. A tracher, a leader or anything and anbody that you feel that changes your world is nothing but the “image of someone or something changing the world” that you created.
18. In reality everyone is alone in this world.

*“When there is space between you and the object you are observing you will know there is no love, and without love, however hard you try to reform the world or bring about a new social order or however much you talk about improvements, you will only create agony. So it is up to you. There is no leader, there is no teacher, there is nobody to tell you what to do. You are alone in this mad brutal world.”*  - J, Krishnamurti

### Chapter 12: (The Observer and the Observed)
1. When you build a image of anyone or anything, so all there will be the image you watch and you (the observer)
2. When you see something, all you subconsiously think is if you like it or don’t. This like and dislike are influenced by your conditioning and the knowledge aquired.
3. It is from this conditioned centre the observer, observes, hence they are always separate from the observed.
4. The observer is aware of the images they create. But is the observer different from these images? Isn’t the observer just an image? 
5. The observer is always adding and subtracting from what they are
   1. Example: Something is more than them or less than them 
6. And they themselves keep on changing according to the pressures added by these images.
7. Ultimately living in the field of consciousness, which is their own knowledge, influence and innumerable calculations.
8. But when the observer looks at themselves, they can see that they are made up of memories, experiences, accidents, influences, traditions and infinite varieties of suffering, all of which are past.
9. So the observed is looking with dead past and alive present, and they perceive everything in the world as same too. Half dead and half alive.
10. With the dual state of mind, that is in the field of time (trapped in past and projecting on present), we look at the object (fear, jealousy, war, family etc..) and try to solve its problem.
11. But while seeing those objects, we do not see with fresh lens, but we see them with the lens of past. 
12. This lens of past just bringforth the images that are not real and present but make you feel that they are real and present, when you are perceiving reality not as it is, but with an image. then there comes the conflict.
13. LIke how one image creares another image, the image was created by observer, because observer themselves is the image.
14. There’s no “I”, the “I” has been put together by the past memories and knowledge..
15. Without reasling that “I” is an image, we impose that “I” into the present, where “I” is made of past.
16. When the I says; this is right or this is wrong or this is should be get rid of etc…it is doing nothing but bringng the past of “I” into the present of observed. 
17. Let's say, Ambedkar is "I", but that i is influenced by ideologies like Social Justice and Buddhism, these ideologies themselves came out of another idea. So ultimately "I" is an idea of an idea of idea...
18. So when we say "I want to get rid of this", it simply mean that an image of "I" wants to get rid of another image by creating a new image. So the whole process is revolving around images, without involving the reality. So the reality is left out and creates conflict.

*“So we come to a point  where we can say, ‘The observer is also the image, only he has separated himself and observes. This observer who has come into being through various other images thinks himself permanent and between himself and the images he has created there is a division, a time interval. This creates conflict between himself and the images he believes to be the cause of his troubles. So then he says, “I must get rid of this conflict”, but the very desire to get rid of the conflict creates another image.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

19. So the observer is the central image that creates all other images. Thsi central image is the censor, experiencer, evaluator, judge who wants to conquer or subjugate other images or destroy them altogther, and through these actions the observer creates further images.

*“the observer is the observed”*  - J, Krishnamurti

*“So awareness has revealed the different states of one’s mind, has revealed the various images and the contradiction between the images, has revealed the resulting conflict and the despair at not being able to do anything about it and the various attempts to escape from it. All this has been revealed through cautious hesitant awarenessm and then comes the awareness that the observer is the observed.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

20. If “I” is the central image, then who is the entity that is going to receive the answer? who is going to enquire? 
21. Even if the entity is part of consciousness or thought, that entity cannot be found out by though or consciousness. 
22. All the consiounness and thought can find out is awarenss. But not the enitity of awareness. 
23. That enitity don’t tell itself to be aware (which in turn creates another image of being aware), it just becomes aware.
24. This awareness that observer is the observed is not to identigy ourselves with the observed,
25. This process of identification is what led to many conflicts; such as identifying with caste, religion, region, Nation etc..
26. So here it is not about understanding verbally, but understanding something to the core.

*“In ancient China before an artist began to paint anything - a tree, for instance - he would sit down in front of it for days, months, years, it didn't matter how long, until he was the tree. He did not identify himself with the tree but he was the tree. This means that there is no space between him and the tree, no space between the observer and the observed, no experiencer experiencing the beauty, the movement, the shadow, the depth of a leaf, the quality of colour. He was totally the tree, and in that state only could he paint."*  - J, Krishnamurti

27. When the observer becomes aware that they are the observed. They stop acting. Till then they said “I should do this or that”,  but with the awarenss they realise they are what they observed. And they stop acting. And conflict stops.

*"The observer has always said, 'I must do something about these images, I must suppress them or give them a different shape; he is always active in regard to the observed, acting and reacting passionately or casually...'I like, therefore I must hold. I dislike therefore I must get rid of'. But when the observer realises that the thing about which he is acting is himself, then there is no conflict between himself and the image. He is that. He is not separate from that. When he was separate, he did, or tried to do, something about it, but when the observer realises that he is that, then there is no like or dislike and conflict ceases."*  - J. Krishnamurti

28. If something you, what you need to do? You cannot run away because it is you, you cannot rebel because it is you, you cannot accept because you don’t need to as it is you. 
29. So, you have no choice but to end all the action that comes as a reaction to like or dilike of you.
30. When you find that your awareness of you became tremendously alive, you become free from any attachment to any image. 
31. This awareness there’s a different kind of attention arises in your mind, this mind(awareness) becomes extraordinarliy sensitive and highly intelligent.

*“Then you will find that there is an awareness that has become tremendously alive. It is not bound  to any central issue to any image - and from that intensity of awareness there is a different quality of attention and therefore the mind - because the mind is this awareness - has become extraordniarily sensitive and highly intelligent.’”*  - J, Krishnamurti

### Chapter 13: (What is Thinking? - Ideas and Action - Challenge - Matter - The Beginning of Thought)
1. What is thinking? What is the Significant Thought which must be exercised with care, logic and sanity. What is that insignificant thought?
2. Why thought has become so important in our lives?
3. Why is one slave to thought? The thought that is clever, cunning, that can organise, construct, bred wars, create fear and anxiety (making and chasing the images forever)

#### Ideas and Action:
1. Ideas became more important than action.
2. The more cunning and more subtle the ideas are, the more we worship them. And the books that contain them. 
3. We are so heavily conditioned by all such ideas.
4. So if our thoughts are heavily conditioned by such relgiious dogmas, we need to question the whole edifice of such ideas.
5. Ideas are always of past, but it is the action that stays in present and is living.
6. We are afraid of livign and therefore the past as ideas has become important to us.

*“We have separated ideas from action because ideas are always of the past and action is always the present - that is, living is always the present. We are afraid of living and therefore the past, as ideas, has become so important to us.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

7. What’s extraordinary is to observe the thought, and trace back to its root. Which is the begining of memory. It is for sure the memory is within us, without memory there won’t be thought.
8. Thought sustains and gives continuity to yesterday’s pleasure and pain.
9. The experiencer, the thinker, is the pleasure and pain and also the entity that gives nourishment to the pleasure and pain.
10. The very demand for pleasure is what invites pain. As the thinker separates pleasure from pain.

*“The thinker separates pleasure from pain. He doesn’t see that in the very demand for pleasure he is inviting pain and fear. Though in human relationships is always demanding pleasure which it covers by different words like loyalty, helping, giving, sustaining, serving.”*  - J, Krishnamurti

11. Thought is so manupulative, that it distorts the reality for its convinience of gettig pleasure.
12. It breeds duality in its chase of pleasure, it desires pleasure from violence and at same time it desires pleasure from peace.
13. It not just breeds duality, infact it accumulates, innumerable memories of past.

*“Thought is so cunning, so clever, that it distorts everything for its own convenience. Thought in its demand for pleasure brings its own bondage.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Challenge:
14. The Challenges we meet are completely new, but we face them with the past thoughts, that is where the conflict, the contradiction and misery starts.

*“As every challenge is met in terms of the past - a challenge ebing always new - our meeting of the challenge will always be totally inadequate, hence contradiction, conflict and all the misery and sorrow we are heir to. Our little brian is in conflict whatever it does. Whether it aspires, imitates, conforms, suppresses, sublimates, takes drugs to expand itself - whatever it does - it is in a state of conflict and will produce conflict.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Matter:
15. Where there is matter, there is energy, and where there is energy, there is matter.
16. Thoughts involves energy, hence thinking is materialistic
17. When there is hamony between the matter and energy, then there is balance and more active the brain cells are. 

*“Matter and energy are interrelated, The one cannot exist without the other, and the more harmony there is between the two, the more balance, the more active the brain cells are. Thought has set up this pattern of pleasure, pain, fear, and has been functioning inside it for thousands of years and cannot break the pattern because it has created it.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### The Beginning of Thought:
18. Thought can never see a new fact, it can understand later, but at that moment understanding of new fact is not reality to thought.
19. The old brain cannot solve new problem, thought can never solve the pyschological problem.

*“Thought can never solve any problem. However clever, however cunning, however erudite, whatever the structure thought creates through science, through an electronic brain, through compulsion or neccessity, thought is never new and therefore it can never answer any tremendous question. The old brain cannot solve the enormous problem.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

20. Thought is wicked, it invents things that are not there, perform extraordinary tricks, one shouldn’t depend on thought.
21. When you understand whole structure of thinking, why you think, words you use, way you behave, way you talk to people, way you walk, way you eat, then the mind may nor deceive you. Instead it obeys you

*“…if you understand the whole structure of how you think, why you think, the words you use, the way you behave in your daily life, the way you talk to people, the way you treat people, the way you walk, the way you eat - if you are aware of all these things then your mind will not deceive you, then there is nothing to be deceived. The mind then is not something that demands, that subjugates; it becomes extraordinarily quiet, pliable, sensitive, alone, and in that state there is no deception wahtsoever.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

22. In the state of complete attention (the observer), the ‘me’ comes to an end, and thought begin to wither away.

*“Have you ever noticed that when you are in a state of complete attention the observer, the thinker, the centre, the ‘me’, comes to an end? In that state of attention thought begins to wither away.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

23. If one want to see a thing clearly, their mind should be very quiet. (without any prejudices, stereotypes, chattering, dialogue, images and pictures)
24. In that silence we can observe the beginning of thought. 
25. It is only in that silence, the beginning of thought can be observed, the silence that comes after puting up the question ‘What is the beginning of thought?’

*“If one wants to see a thing very clearly, one’s mind be very quiet, without all the prejudices, the chattering, the dialogue, the images, the pictures - all that must be put aside to look. And it is only in silence that you can observe the beginning of thought - not when you are searching, asking questions, waiting for reply. So it is only when you are completely quiet, right throught your being, having put that question, ‘What is the beginning of thought?’, that you will begin to see, out of the silence, how thought takes shape.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

26. When we are aware of the beginning of the thought, then there is no need to control the thought.
27. All the while we live in a conflict of deciding which is a good thought and bad thought. When we become aware of the beginning of the thought. There will be no contradiction.

*“‘This is a good thought, I must think about it a lot. This is a ugly thought, I must suppress it.’ There is a battle going on all the time between one thought and another, one desire and another, one pleasure dominating all other pleasures. But if there is an awareness of the beginning of thought, then there is no contradiction in thought.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

28. The statements ‘Thought is always old’ or ‘Time is sorrow’, if one transaltes them or interpretes them then there is again another thought which is the product of yesterday’s knowledge.
29. Instead one has to give complete attention to those statements. Then you will realise there is neither oberserver nor the observed, neither the thinker nor the thought.
30. WHen there is no thought, no thought derived from memory, then there is no thinker. For they see the problem as it is and the journey of life as it is.

*“You can observe in yourself that as long as there is no thought - which doesn’t mean a state of amnesia, of blankness - as long as there is no thought derived from memory, experience or knowledge, which are all of the past, there is no thinker at all. This is not a philosophical or mystical affair. We are dealing with actual facts, and you will see, if you have gone this far in the journey, that you will respond to a challenge, not with the old brain, but totally anew.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 14: (The Burden of Yesterday - The Quiet Mind - Communication - Achievement - Discipline - Silence - Truth and Reality)
1. In the modern life, no one is truly in solitude.
2. Even when we are alone, we are crowded by the influences of many people, knowedge, memories.
3. With all these experiences there exists  so much anxiety, misery, conflict that our minds become duller and duller, more and more insensitive.
4. Are we even alone? or are we just carriers of past influences?

*“In the life we generally lead there is very little solitude. Even when we are alone our lives are crowded by so many influences, so much knowledge, so many memories of so many experiences, so much anxiety, misery and conflict that our minds become duller and duller, more and more insensitive, functioning in a monotonous routine. Are we ever alone? Or are we carrying with us all the burdens of yesterday?”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### The Burden of Yesterday:
1. We usually carry our burden, never let them die, or leave behind.
2. It is only when we give complete attention to our problem and solve it immediately, we stop carrying them to the next day.
3. When we stop carrying, there is solitude, it doesn’t matter you are in a crowded place or not, but if you stop carrying the yesterday’s burden, you will have solitude. A Fresh and Innocent Mind,

*“We carry our burdens all the time; we never die to them, we never leave them behind. It is only when we give complete attention to a problem and solve it immediately - never carrying it over to the next day, the next minute - that there is solitude. Then, even if we live in a crowded house or are in a bus, we have solitude. And that solitude indicates a fresh mind, an innocent mind.”* - J. Krishnamurti

4. Inward Solitude and Space is important for Freedom to Go, Function and Fly.
5. For Goodness to blossom like a flower, it needs Space, for Virtue to blossom it needs freedom. 
6. All the legal freedoms doesn’t indicate that we are free.
7. Only when there is space, any worthwhile quality could grow, only when there is solitude (uninfleunced or untrained by anything) the mind comes up with something new.

*“To have inward solitude and space is very important because it implies freedom to be, to go, to function, to fly. After all, goodness canonly flower in space just as virtue can flower only when there is freedom…No virtue, no quality that is worth while, can function or grow without this vast space within oneself. And space and silence are necessary because it is only when the mind is alone, uninfluenced, untrained, not held by infinite varieties of experience, that it can come upon something totally new.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### The Quiet Mind:
8. It is only when one’s mind is quiet there is a possibility of clarity.
9. That is what the Mediation is actually aiming for, to quiet the mind. 
10. According to J.Krishnamurti, the silence of mind, happens on the foundation of freing onelsef from fear, from sorrow, anxiety and all the traps one lays for oneself.

*“One can see directly that it is only when the mind is silent that there is a possibility of clarity.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Communication
11. Even in Communication, one should be intense, both the speaker and the listener, without any comparison or passing the words through lens of past knowledge, without sraining oneself with the effort to comprehend, one should just Observe.

*“Communication between us implies, doesn’t it, that not only must you understand the words i am using but that we must both, you an I, be intense at the same time, not a moment later or a moment sooner and capable of meeting each other on the same level? And such commnication is not possible when you are interpreting what you are reading according to your own knowledge, pleasure or opinions, or when you are making a tremendous effort to comprehend.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Achievement 
12. The greatest stumbling blocks in life is this constant struggle to reach, to achieve, to acquire. 
13. But this achievement of physical security through Job or something would not lead to pyschological security.
14. We all want pyschological security (relationships, attitudes and activities, but here too there is no such security.

*“It seems to me that one of the greatest stumbling blocks in life is this constant struggle to reach, to achieve, to acquire. We are trained from childhood to acquire and to achieve - the very brain cells themselves create and demand this pattern of achievement in order to have physical security, but pyschological security is not within the field of achievement…To find out for yourself that there is no form of security in any relationship - to realise that pyschologically there is nothing permanent - gives a totally different approach to life.”* - J. Krishnamurti

#### Discipline:
1. How can a mind, endlessly active in its self-interest be quiet?
2. One can discipline it, control it but that torture makes it more dull.
3. The mere pursuit of ideal of having a quiet mind itself creates disquiet.
4. But at same time undsciplined mind also results nothing.

*…how can a mind which is so endlessly active in its self-interest be quiet? One can discipline it, but such torture does not make the mind quiet; it merely makes it dull. Obviously the mere pursuit of the ideal of having a quiet mind is valueless because the more you force it the more narrow and stagnant it becomes. Control in any form, like suppression, produces only conflict. So control and outward discipline are not the way, nor has an undisciplined life any value.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

5. Most of the us are disciplined outwardly by the demands of society, by the family, by our own suffering, by our own experience, by conforming to certain ideology.
6. Accroding to JK, such discipline is most deadening thing.
7. Discipline is not suppression, it comes without control, without any form of fear.
8. It is not discipline first and Freedom next, it is always Freedom first and discipline next.
9. To understand the Freedom from conformity is discipline itself. The very act of learning is discipline.
10. To understand this whole nature of control, suppresion and indulgence demands attention.

*“Most of our lives are outwardly disciplined by the demands of society, by the family, by our own suffering, by our own experience, by conforming to certain ideological or factual patterns - and that form of discipline is the most deadening thing. Discipline must be without control, without suppression, without any form of fear.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

11. One don’t need discipline to study what discipline is, instead the act of Studying brings brings discipline.
12. To deny the authority(the psychological authority of religions, traditions, society etc..) one must study why one obeys the authority in first place.
13. For studying it, we should be free of all condemnation, justification, opinion or acceptance.
14. We cannot accept authority and yet study it, so when we are studying the authority, we are indeed denying it, and that very denial is freedom from authority. This freedom beings the queitness of mind

*“Now we cannot accept authority and tet study it - that is impossible. To study the whole pyschological structure of the authority within ourselves there must be freedom. And when we are studying we are denying the whole structure, and when we do deny, that very denial is the light of mind that is free from authorty.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

*“Negation of everything that has been considered worthwhile, such as outward discipline, leadership, idealism, is to study it; then that vey act of studying is not only discipline but the negative of it, and the very denial is a positive act. So we are negating all those things that are considered important to bring about quietness of mind.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

15. It is not control that brings Quietness of mind.
16. Nor mind is quiet when it is made absorbed by an object, this is similar to giving a child a toy, the child gets absorbed in playing with that toy, and when the toy is taken away, he again become mischievous.

*“Thus we see it is not control that leads to quietness. Nor is the mind quiet when it has an object which is so absorbing that it gets lost in that object. This is like giving a child an interesting toy; he becomes very quiet, but remove the toy and he returns to his mischief-making. We all have our toys which absorb us and we think we are very quiet but if a man is dedicated to a certain form of activity, scientific, literary or whatever it is, the toy merely absorbs him and he is not really quiet at all.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Silence
17. The only silence we know is the silence that comes when the thought stops but that is not actual silence too
18. Silence is not that occurs when our brain cells stay quiet, it is not an outcome of attention where the observer is observed, though there will no friction in that instance, it is not silence too.
19. It is something entirely different like beauty and love.

#### Truth and the Reality
19. There in no way one can describe silence.
20. If it is something that can be described, then it becomes known, but the Freedom is something has no known, in that freedom every known dies everyday.

*“You are waiting for me to describe what this silence is so that you can compare it, interpret it, carry it away and bury it. It cannot be described. What can be described is the known, and the freedom from the known can come into being only when there is dying every day to the known, to the hurts, the flatteries, to all the images you have made, to all your experiences- dying every day so that the brian cells themselves become fresh, young, innocent.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

21. But that innocence too doesn’t not produce love, it neither related beauty nor love.
22. The silence of ending the noise is just the beginning of the actual silence. 
23. It is like entering the the ocean through a tunnel, and being still at the tunnel.
24. If one understands the the structure of consciousness, meaning of pleasure, sorrow and despair then they can understand that they are at the tunnel.
25. And then you may come upon that mystery no one can reveal or describe to you.
26. The you relaise the mind is living and the livign mind has no center, no space and time it becomes limitless and that is the only truth and reality.

*A living mind is a still mind, a living mind is a mind that has no center and therefore no space and time. Such a mind is limitless and that is the only truth, that is the only reality.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter 15: (Experience-Satisfaction-Duality-Meditation)
#### Experience:
1. We all want experiences of somekind or other. (the mystical experience, the religious experience, sexual experience, having money, power, position, domination)
2. As we grwo older, we may have finished with the demands of our physical appetite, but we still search for more and more.
3. We try to expand our consiousness or consume drugs (an old trick existed from time immemorial)
4. All this demand for more and more experiences proves the inward poverty of a man.

*“This is old trick which has existed from time immemorial - chewing a piece of leaf or experimenting  with the latest chemical to bring about temporary alteration in the structure of the brain cells, a greater sensitivity and heightened perception whcih give a semblance of reality. This demand for more and more experiences shows the inward poverty of man.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

5. We think we can escape ourseles through experiences, but ourselves is what lead to experiences. When mind is consumed by negativity, it takes the very next drug but through drugs the mind will see its own projection.

*“We think that through experiences we can escape from ourselves but these expereinces are conditioned by what we are. If the mind is petty, jealous, anxious, it may take the very latest form of drug but it will still see only its  own little creation, its own little projections from its own conditioned background.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Satisfaction:
6. Most of us demand a satisfying and lasting expereince that cannot be destroyed by thought, behind this deman there is desire for satisfaction, 
7. Great satisfaction comes from great pleasure, the more wider the experience the more the pleasure, the pleasure decides what the experience should be also pleasure is the measure by which we measure experience.
8. As the experience is measurable, it is within the limit of thought, and it is apt to create illusion.
9. One can have marvellous experiences and yet be completely deluded.
10. One inevitably sees visions and witness the experiences according to their conditioning, the greater the believer one is for a particular condition, the stronger will be the visions and projections of ouwn demands and urges.

*“To have some great satisfaction is a great pleasure; the more lasting, deep and wide the experience the more pleasurable it is, so pleasure dictates the form of experience we demand, and pleasure is the measure by which we measure the experience. Anything measurable is within the limits of thought and is apt to create illusion. You can have marvellous experiences and yet be completely deluded. You will inevitably see visions according to your conditionig; you will see Christ or Buddha or whoever you happen to believe in, and the greater a believer you are the stronger will be your visions, the projections of your own demands and urges.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

11. When you demand truth, the measure of the experince of understanding that truth is Pleasure, this indicates that you have already projected what that experience should be, and therefor it is nothing new or valid.
12. Again what do we mean by Experience? Is there anything new or original in experience?
13. Experience is the bundle of memories responding to the challenge, whenever we face a situation our mind reacts using memories,conditioning, past knowledge, fears, pleasures
14. Experience becomes an experience only when you recognise it “Ah this is good or bad or beautiful etc..”
15. But the recognition of an experience itself indicates that it is not something new but old.
16. If thought can think about reality, it will never be a reality

*“If thought can think about reality it cannot be reality. We cannot recognise a new experience. It is impossible. We recognise only something we have already known and therefore when we say we have had a new experience it is not new at all. To seek further experience through expansion of consciousness, as is being done through various pyschedelic drugs, is still within the field of consciousness and therefore very limited.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

17. So the mind that seeks newer cravings and newer experiences is just livign with older beliefs and conditioning, inturn being Shallow.

*“So we have discovered a fundamental truth, which is that a mind that is seeking, craving, for wider and deeper experience is a very shallow and dull mind because it lives always with its memories.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

18. We think that the challenges and experiences are what that keep us awake. Otherwise we assume that we all would become dull.
19. But this dependance itself is what makes our mind more and more dull, it doesn’t really keep us awake.
20. (While studying when parents strictness stagnated, you go to college, when college stagnated, you seek job, when job got stagnated you seek marriage, but nowhere once you questioned what is good to do! all you did is kept on seeing)

*"...So challenges are neccessary for most of us; we think that without them our minds will become stupid and heavy, and therefore we depend on a challenge, an experience, to give us more excitement, more intensity, to make our minds sharper. But in fact this dependence on challenges and experiences to keep us awake, only makes our minds duller - it doesn’t really keep us awake at all.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

21. Now the Question is: Is it possibel to keep awake totally without any challenge or any experience?
22. For being awae, implies great sensitivity both physical and pyschological, it means to be free from all demands.
23. The moment you demand is the moment you experience.
24. For being free of demand and satisfaction necessitates investigation into yourself and an understanding of whole nature of deman.

*"So I ask myself, is it possible to keep awake totally...totally awake without any challenge or any experience? This implies a great sensitivity, both physical and psychological; it means I have to be free of all demands, for the moment...And to be free of deman and satisfaction neccessitates investigation into myself and an understanding of the whole nature of demand."*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Duality:
1. Demand is born out of duality: 'I am unhappy and I am must be happy.'
2. But in the very attempt to compesate with duality, ex: trying to be happy is where unhappiness lies
3. Whatever you demand makes what you have even more stronger. 
4. This never ending corridor of duality is what creates the suffering.
5. One can free from this incessant demand through knowing oneself completely only then mind no longer seeks.

*"Everything affirmed contains its own opposite, and effort to overcome strengthens that against which it strives. When you demand an experience of truth or reality, that very demand is born out of your discontent with 'what is', and therefore the demand creates the opposite. And in the opposite there is what has been. So one must be free of this incessant demand, otherwise there will be no end to the corridor of duality. This means knowing yourself so completely that the mind is no longer seeking."*  - J. Krishnamurti

6. The Mind that has known oneself does not demand experience, it need no challenge. It is just what it is.
7. It is the frustrated, narrow, shallow mind, the conditioned mind that is seekign more.
8. It is possible to live in this world without the more, without everlasting comparison but it is upto the Individual to find out how.

*"Such a mind(where one knows themselves completely) does not demand experience; it cannot ask for a challenge or know a challenge; it does not say, 'I am asleep' or 'I am awake'. It is completely what it is. Only the frustrated, narrow, shallow mind, the conditioned mind, is always seeking the more. Is it possible then to live in this world without the more - without this everlasting comparison? Surely it is? But one has to find out oneself."*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Meditation:
1. Investigating this whole question of knowing oneself is Meditation.
2. From East to West there are many different schools that are teaching Meditation through different systems and methods. Ex:
   1. watch movement of your big toe
   2. Sitting in certain postion, breathing regularly or practising awareness.
   3. Repeating certain word again and again
3. JK claims all these are mechanical, especially repeating a certain word again and again, he claimed it to be sheer nonsense(just a form of self-hypnosis).

*"''Watch the movement of your big toe, watch it, watch it; there are other systems which advocate sitting in a certain posture, breathing regularly or practicing awareness. All this is utterly mechanical. Another method gives you a certain word and tells you that if you go on repeating it you will have some extraordinary transcendental experience. This is sheer nonsense. It is a form of self-hypnosis. By repeating Amen or Om or Coca-Cola indefinitely you will obviously have a certain expereince because by repitition the mind becomes quiet. It is  a well known phenomenon which has been practised for thousands of years in India - Mantra Yoga it is called."*  - J. Krishnamurti

4. One can put flower infornt of a stick everyday, and withing 30days they will be worshipping the stick and not putting the flower infront of that stick becomes a sin.
5. Meditation is not following any system, it is not a constant repetition, it is not concentration.
6. If someone is forced to concentrate, then they are forced into a conflictted states when they are battling between intention to concentrate on on thing and you mind which wanders somewhere else. If your mind wanders off it means you are interested in something else.
7. It is more important to observe where the mind wanders and what it is dealign with and why it is dealing.

*"Meditation is not following any system; it is not constant repitition and imitation. Meditation is not concentration. It is one of the favourite gambits of some teachers of meditation to insist on their pupils learning concentration - that is, fixing the mind on one thought and driving out all other thoughts. This is a most stupid, ugly thing, which any schoolboy can do because he is forced to. It means that all the time you are having a battle between the insistence that you must concentrate on the one hand and your mind on the other which wanders away to all sorts of other things, whereas you shouuld be attentive to every movement of mind wherever it wanders. When your mind wanders off it means you are interested in something else."*  - J. Krishnamurti

8. Meditation:
   1. It demands astonishingly alert mind
   2. It is understanding the totality of life without fragmentation
   3. It is not the control of thought, a controlled thought breeds conflict in mind.
   4. It is to understand the structure and origin of thought.
   5. That very understanding is Meditaiton
   6. It is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, not to say it right ot wrong but just to watch it and move with it.
   7. It is the silence that comes when the Thought understood its own Structure, its beginning and  its Nature.

*"Meditation is not control of thought, for when thought is controlled it breeds conflict in the mind, but when you understand the structure and origin of thought, which we have already been into, then thought will not interefere. That very understanding of the structure of thinking is its own discipline which is meditation."*  - J. Krishnamurti

9. In watching your thought and feelign, there comes awareness and out of this awareness there comes silence.
10. Silence that is artificially generated through manipulating thought is dead.
11. But silence that comes when thought has understood its own Structure and Nature is Mediation.

*"Meditation is to be aware of every thought and of every feeling, never to say it is right or wrong but just to watch it and move with it. In that watching you begin to understand the whole movement of thought and feeling. And out of this awareness comes silence. Silence put together by thought is stagnation, is dead, but the silence that comes when thought has understood its own beginning, the nature of itself, understood how all thought is never free but always old - this silence is meditation in which the meditator is entirely absent, for the mind has emptied itself of the past."*   - J. Krishnamurti

12. If one reads a book attentively one one hour then it is meditation, if one just takes notes to refer later is no longer a meditation. 
13. Meditation is state of mind that looks with complete attention, totally not just parts.
14. And how to be attentive is taught by no one.
15. When one becomes aware of oneself, what they do, talk, see, feel without deliberate choice but being naturally aware is meditation.

*"If you have read this book for a whole hour attentively, that is meditation. If you have merely taken away few words and gathered few ideas to think about later, then it is no longer meditation."*  - J. Krishnamurti

*"Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totallly, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attnetive to the system and that is not attention."* - J. Krishnamurti

*"Meditation is one of the greatest arts in life - perhaps the greatest, and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it. It has no technique and therefore no authority. When you learn about yourself, watch yourself, watch they way to walk, how you eat, what you say, the gossip, the hat, the jealousy - if you are aware of all that in yourself, without any choice, that is part of meditation."*  - J. Krishnamurti

16. Meditation can take plae when one is sitting in bus, or wlaking in woods, or seeing their loved ones or anywhere at anyplace and can happen always.
17. In the understanding of meditation, there is love. Love happens only when there is complete silence, when mind stops creating images, opinions or perceptions, there will be all prevading love.
18. There will be no condemnation in observation.
19. And such an observation is a kind discipline that is free, fluid and carries no confirmity.


*“In the understanding of meditation there is love, and love is not the product of systems, of habits, of following a method. Love cannot be cultivated by thought. Love can perhaps come into being when there is complete silence, a 160 silence in which the meditator is entirely absent; and the mind can be silent only when it understands its own movement as thought and feeling.”* - J. Krishnamurti

*“To understand this movement of thought and feeling there can be no condemnation in observing it. To observe in such a way is the discipline, and that kind of discipline is fluid, free, not the discipline of conformity.”* - J. Krishnamurti

### Chapter - 16 Total Revolution (The Religious Mind - Energy - Passion)
1. The main thing about which we have been concerned in this book is bringing about in ourselves and in our lives, a Total Revolution, irrespective of sturcture of Society we live in,
2. The Society is horrifying with its wars and aggression.
3. We need to bring a Revolution in our Brain, the old brain is polluted with ideologies.
4. So, is it possible to bring mutation in brain cells themselves?

*“is it possible for a human being living in an ordinary everyday life in this brutal, violent, ruthless world - a world which is becoming more and more efficient and therefore more and more ruthless - is it possible for him to bring about a revolution not only in his outward relationships but in the whole field of his thinking, feeling, acting and reacting.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

5. When we see all the appalling things happening in this world, we either tell ourselves “i can’t do anything about it” or ask ourseleves “How can I influence the world?”
6. But one can  largely influence the world in they themselves ar enot violent, lead a peaceful lfie everyday. (without enimity, jealousy, envy, competition or ambition)

*“You may say, ‘I can’t do anything about it,’ or, ‘How can I influence the world?’ I think you can tremendously influence the world if in yourself you are nto violent, if you lead actually everyday a peaceful life - a life which is not competitive, ambitious, envious - a life which does not create enmity. Small fires can become a blaze.”* - J. Krishnamurti

7. It is our self-centered activity that reduced our world into present state of Chaos, and above that when we say we cannot do anything, then it is more like accepting disorder in ourselves as inevitable.
8. When we ouselves are broken, our relationship with the world will also be broken
9. But if, we act totally then there will be total revolution in the relationship.

*“We have reduced the world to its present state of chaos by our self-centered activity, by our prejudices, our hatreds, our nationalism, and when we say we cannot do anything about it, we are accepting disorder in ourselves as inevitable. We have splintered the world into fragments and if we oursleves are broken, fragmented, our relationship with the world will also be broken. But if, when we act, we act totally, then our relationship with the world undergoes a tremendous revolution.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

10. Any movement which is worthwhole, any action which has any deep significance, must begin with each one of us.

*“After all, any movement which is worth while, any action which has any deep significance, must begin with each one of us. I must change first; I must see what is the nature and structure of my relationship with the world - and in the very seeing is the doing; therefore I, as a human being living in the world, bring about a different quality, and that quality, it seems to me, is the quality of religious mind.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### The Relgiious Mind:
1. A religious mind is different from the mind that believes in religion.
2. One cannot be religious and be a Hindu, Christian, Buddhist or Muslim.
3. A religious mind does not seek at all, it does follow the dictate of any religion, there is no belief or fear in religious mind, there is only what is.

*“A religious mind does not seek at all, it cannot experiment with truth. Truth is not something dictated by your pleasure or pain, or by your conditioning as a Hindu or whatever religion you belong to. The religious mind is a state of mind in which there is no fear and therefore no belief whatsoever but only ‘what is’ - what actually is.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

4. In religious mind there is silence, which comes not out of thought but out of awareness. 
5. In that silence there is Energy that is devoid of conflict.

#### Energy:
1. Energy is action and movement.
2. All movement is action and all action is energy.
3. All thought is energy.
4. All livign is energy.
5. All life is energy.
6. When that energy is allowed to flow without any contradiction, without any friction or conflict, then that energy is boundless.

*“All action is movement and all action is energy. All desire is energy. All feeling is energy.. All thought is energy. All livign is energy. All life is energy. If that energy is allowed to flow without any contradiction, wihtout any friction, without any conflict,t hen that energy is boundless, endless.”*  - J. Kirhsnamurti

7. Why human beings always bring friction to this energy.
8. Is pure energy without any friction, remains as a mere idea to a human?
9. Every friction is a waste of energy, whether it be any of our relationships inward or outward (ex: husband-wife, our beliefs and reality, between communities etc..)
10. When there is time interval between observer and the observed, the energy gets wasted in forming the image of the observed.
11. But when there is no time interval, when the observer becomes the observed, there is no “I”, then there will be action without any motive of “I”.

*“As long as there is a time interval between the observer and the observed it creates friction and therefore there is a waste of energy. That energy is gathered to its highest point when the observer is observed, in which there is no time interval at all. Then there will be energy without motive and it will find its own channel of action because then the ‘I’ do not exist.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

12. When we realise all the established discplines, teachings, philosophies are not the way we ask ourselves.
13. Is it possible to break through this heavy conditioning of centuries and not enter into another conditionioning? Is it possible to be free? So that mind can altogether be new, sensitive, alive, aware, intense, capable? 
14. All that matters is not being told, but Asking oneself.

*“We want to be told. One of the most curious things n the structure of our pysche is that we all want to be told becasue we are the result of the propaganda of ten thousand years. We want to have our thinking confirmed and corroborated by another, whereas to ask a question is to ask it of yourself. What I say has very little value. You will forget it the moment you shut this book, or you will remeber and repeat certain phrases, or you will compare what you have read here with some other book - you will not face your own life. And that is all that matters - your life, yourself, your pettiness, your shallowness, your brutality, your violence, your greed, your ambition, you daily agony and endless sorrow - that is what you have to understand and nobdy on earth or in heavin is going to save you from it but yourself.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

15. It is only when you know yourself with one look in one breath as You are, then only you will understand the whole structure of man’s psyche.

*“When you know yourself as you are, then you understand the whole structure of man’s endeavour, his decptions, his hypocrisies, his search.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

19. To know yourself you must be honest to yourself
20. When you are acting according to your principles or ideals, you are being dishonest to yourself, because you are actign according to what you the image you have, but not what you are.
21. So can we be just alive? And look ourselves?

*“To do this(know yourself) you must be tremendously honest with yourself throughout your being. When you act according to your principles you are being dishonest because when you act according to what you think you ought to be, you are not what you are. It is a brutal thing to have idelals. If you have any ideals, beliefs or principles you cannot possibly look at yourself directly. So can you be completely negative, completely quiet, neither thinking nor afraid, and yet be extrordinarily, passionately alive?”*  - J. Krishnamurti

#### Passion:
22. When we attain a state of mind which is no longer capable of striving. (effort born out of desire, movement born ‘of becoming’: I must be enlightened, I must be peaceful, I must be something)
23. That state of mind is the true Relgious mind, in that state one may come upon what everyone call bliss or God, or beauty or love.
24. This State of mind cannot be invited, it can only be sought, because the mind is too silly, emotions are too shoddy, life is too confused,  for such a state of mind to be invited.
25. To invite it, one must know it, and the thing is one cannot know it.

*“You cannot invite it. To invite it you must know it and you cannot know it. It doesn’t matter who says it, the moment he says, ‘I know’, he does not know. The moment you say you have found it. If you say you have experienced it, you jave never experienced it. Those are all ways of exploiting another man - your friend or your enemy.”*  - J. Krishnamurti

26. Can this thing come upon without inviting? Like a breeze that comes when the door is open? One cannot invite invite but only can open the door.
27. But if you are in state of waiting, that is nother decpetion, if you believe you opened then it is a thought. 
28. Why Human Beings lack this thing? Why there is emptiness in heart.
29. Having sex and children indicated comapnionship, friendship indicates understanding, but none of these are unfading flower, they are always rooted in depndency, expectation or self-interest.
30. All those relationships prove the tenderness of Human, but still inwardly the human is empty.
31. Why a human who is so cleaver and achieved many feats couldn’t find this one thing that matters the most?
32. What is your answer be, if you put yourself to the question?
33. But our answer is in accordance with your intensity in asking the question and the urgency of it, but we are neither intense nor urgent.
34. Intensity needs Energy, Energy comes out of passion, that Passion in which there is no hidden want, but at same time we don’t know where our passion will take us.
35. Is fear of that uncertanity comes from Passion is why you never let passion arise, which lead to not having energy to find out for yourself, why this quality of love is missing?
36. It is only when we become passionate about the question why we don’t have it, will lead to answer that it is there.
37. It is through your negation of the known, the unknown comes into being. One who knows that they are in silence and they love, doesn’t know what love is or silence is.

*“If you are passionate n your discovery to find why you haven’t got it, you will know it is there. Through complete negation alone, which is the highest form of passion, that thing which is love comes into being. Like humility you cannot cultivate love. Humility comes into being when there is total ending of conceit - then you will never know what it is to be humble. A man who knows what it is to have humility is a vain man. In the same way when you give your mind and your heart, your nerves, your eyes, your whole being to find out the way of life, to see what actually is and go beyond it, and deny completely, totally, the life you live now - in that very denial of the ugly, the brutal, the other comes into being. And you will never know it either. A man who knows that he is silent, who knows that he loves, does not know what love is or what silence is.”*  - J. Krishnamurti
