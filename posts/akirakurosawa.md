#personality/movies

#### The Humanistic Cinema of Akira Kurosawa: (Like Stories of Old, Youtube Channel; Video Analysis)
1. AKira took inspiration from all over the world, adpated Shakesphere, Doestoevsky and fan of Hollywood Director John Ford
2. One Signature Trademark: The way he uses moment in story telling (movement of Nature, Characters, Groups, Objects, Scenary and Camera)
3. He uses long lenses to enhance the sensation of movement, combining slow motion to keep you on edge without becoming overwhelmed and to empahsise the drama and emotional weight of action
4. Sidney Lumet: Called Akira’s movies as Beethoven( a recognizable full sound) like fullness
5. Kurosawa works over years inspired many directors, either directly or indirectly

*“His films had a daring, exhilarating visual freedom, and a heart of deep human understanding.”*  - Roger Ebert

*“I suppose all of my films have a common theme. If I think about it, though, the only theme I can think of is really a question: Why can’t people be happier together?”*  - Akira Kurosawa

#### Why Can’t People be Happier together?
1. This is Kurosawa core question
2. Every film of kurosawa circles around this question
3. Irresptive of the time period (moder, feudal, ancient) or the situation (chaos, wars, plagues, corruption); he’s priority would revolve around the question of human harmony
   1. Why do we hurt each other?
   2. Why can’t we understand one another?
   3. What stops us from livign harmoniously?

#### Movement - Nature and Impermanence:
1. Movement is the heartbeat of Kurosawa’s Cinema
2. He uses:
   1. Wind, Rain, Fog, Fire, Dust to show how world never stops changing
   2. Camera motion and actors’ physicality - to create rhythm (a Beethoven liek fullness)
3. This Movement isn’t just a visual style, it is visual storytellling, that conveys: “nothing lasts forever”
4. People, empires, and ideals all get swept up in the same current of change.

#### Vulnerability and Morality:
1. Kurosawa’s characters live in situations that remind them their fragility
2. They face situations like:
   1. Nature’s indifference
   2. The decline of eras
   3. Their own aging, sickness or loss of purpose
3. At same time, his stories and characters remind us of eroding nature of values, cultures and identities.

#### Truth, Trust, and the Limits of Understanding:
1. Kurosawa points out our inability of knowing what’s true
2. he reminds us that:
   1. People Lie - not only to others, but to themselves
   2. Everyone sees reality through their own bias
3. This pointing out gives pyschological depth to his stories
4. Shows how mistrust poisons relatiosnhips and how self-deception can destroy even the noblest intentions

#### The Real Tragedy: Resistance to Change:
1. Kurosawa shows how his characters resist this eternal movement of Nature
2. They cling to:
   1. old Beliefs
   2. Status and Ego
   3. Indentities that no longer fit reality
3. This resistance is where the downfall of character starts

#### Disconnection and Indifference:
1. As people resist natural flow, they grow indifferent to nature, others and themsleves.
2. This is a kind of spiritual and pyschological illenss
3. Few themes through which he relfects this disconnection are:
   1. Bureaucracy, Pride, Greed, Nationalism
   2. He shows that people eventually forgettign compassion
4. But the pivotal theme is that even in the face of despair, his films never lose sight of hope.

#### Redemption and Human Goodness:
1. Kurosawa always sees a ray of hope and shows it to us

*“We may become disconnected, but we are never fully detached”*  - Akira Kurosawa

2. Even in theor last moments, people can still wake up, still reconnect, stil act with compassion

#### Mentors and Moral Vision:
1. Kurosawa designs the Figures from whom we can take inspiration. As they are mostly flawed like us and still endure the life with integrity and care for other’s well-being.
2. They remind us of our potential to live more meaningfully and selflessly

#### Harmony in the midst of Chaos:
1. Kurosawa shows that even in the world of Chaos, one can find meaning through empathy, humility, and courage.

#### My Personal Opinion:
Now coming to my opinion: 
1. "I feel Kurosawa is not just great visual storyteller, but also a visual story conveyor.”
2. He conveys his message in most suble and most impactful way possible. 
3. I have only seen Ikiru, in that most of the time the protagonist is dialogueless but each scene conveys what he wants to tell to himself, to the world and especially to the audience.
4. His turmoil of emotions, his search for meaning, everything is framed in such a way that Kurosawa is just telling "Guys this is what it is”.
5. Very subtle but impactful dialogues are the best example for this. Ex: When the people asks protagonist on why he don't get angry, the protagonist says "I can't get angry, i don't have much time left for that", that single line defines the whole humanity and its pointless worry, hate, jealousy and anger.
