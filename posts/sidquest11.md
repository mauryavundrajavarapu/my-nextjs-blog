It was a noisy little stretch of road, just across from the railway station of a small City  named Rajahmundry, forever buzzing with autorickshaws, bikes, the occasional honk from a restless bus, and the long whistle of passing trains. But nestled between all that bustle, standing quietly in the shade of a peeling tin roof, was a tea stall. 

That’s where Sid had found work, not much he gets, just enough to get by. He brewed the tea, kept the place clean, and handed out the morning papers with a polite smile. The stall belonged to an old man named Srinivas who is eighty, if not older. His children abandoned him the moment they felt him to be a burden to bear. 

Srinivas, though frail, still managed a chuckle or two every now and then. He seemed glad to have Sid around. They even shared a tiny roadside shed behind the stall.

Sid didn’t mind the noise. If anything he liked, it is listening to the chatter that floated in with the steam of the tea from the conversations from passengers, coolies, newspaper boys, and travellers in a hurry. In those passing words, he found stories, bits of lives he’d never lived, but could sit quietly and absorb.

One lazy afternoon, just as Sid was folding up the cloth on the counter and thinking of stretching out for a nap, the old man’s son Ravi came in, rushed and rough, like a sudden wind that didn’t belong.He shoved past Sid without a word, headed straight for the money box, and forced it open.
Sid tried to stop him by grabbing at his arm and raising his voice, but the man was stronger and too quick. With a fistful of crumpled notes, he stormed out as fast as he had come.
Sid stood still for a moment, his breath caught somewhere between anger and helplessness. Then, without a word, he shut the shutters and walked back to the little shed behind the stall.The old man was still asleep, curled up with his back to the wall, unaware of the storm that had just passed through.

“Ohh you came back early” says the Old Man waking up from his sleep

“Yeah”

“Did the business go bad today?”

“No, it’s your Son who made it bad”

“What happened?”

“Your Son has rushed into the Shop and forcefully took away the money from money box, when i tried to obstruct him he pushed me away “

“Ohh Poor Boy! he isn’t realising what he’s doing”

“It’s you who are poor! You son is happily stealing from you”

“You will understand soon, who’s poor, anyway we shouldn’t let this repeat, we should be careful next time”

The next afternoon came much like the last, hot and humming with the sleepy rhythm of the day. But Sid, quiet and careful, had made up his mind. He didn’t place the money in the usual tin box. Instead, he tucked it away safely, and waited.

Just as the clock lazily swung past noon, Ravi burst into the shop again, just as rough, just as restless. But this time, both Sid and the old man, Srinivas, were there.
Without a glance at either of them, Ravi lunged at the box. He flung it open, only to find it empty. His face, already sour with greed, twisted now into rage.

“Where’s the money?” he barked.

Srinivas, calm but trembling slightly, spoke up from his stool.

“Son, this is very wrong to do. You will suffer because of this.”

That only added fire to Ravi’s temper. He turned toward Sid, fists clenched, and struck him hard.

“Tell me where the money is, you placeless beggar!”

Sid shielded himself, wincing but firm. “Begging,” he said, breathless, “is better than stealing.”

Ravi raised his arm again, but before the blow could fall, Srinivas caught his son’s wrist. The old man’s grip was frail, but his eyes still held some strength.

“Stop this, Ravi.”

But Ravi, too far gone in anger to listen, shoved his father aside.

It happened quickly. The old man stumbled back, feet unsure, balance lost, and he fell on the ground. The back of his head hit the stone floor with a dull, sickening thud. Blood began to pool beneath his white hair.

Ravi froze for a moment, his face pale, and then without a word, he turned and ran.

Sid rushed to the old man, cradling his limp body and calling out his name. But there was no answer.
At the hospital, the truth was quiet and cruel. Srinivas was gone.

The police came. They took down statements and followed the trail. Ravi was arrested soon after. Word spread fast. His wife left him. His children were taken away. Neighbours whispered his name with contempt, “the man who killed his own father.”
And in the silence of his cell, Ravi would come to live with what he had done, day after day, alone with the echoes of a life that could have been different.

Few days after this whole incident happened, Sid sat quietly at the riverbank, the earth cool beneath him.The sun was slowly setting over the Godavari, painting the river in streaks of red and gold. The air had grown soft, and the sounds of the world seemed far away. His journal lay open across his knees, and he was writing, slowly, thoughtfully.

*“If Ravi hadn’t raised his hand, the evil wouldn’t have happened.*

*But he raised his hand because he didn’t find the money.*

*If he hadn’t gotten angry over the money, he wouldn’t have hit anyone.*

*But anger was inevitable. He had become used to stealing.*

*If he hadn’t started stealing in the first place, maybe none of this would’ve happened.*

*But that too began somewhere.He abandoned his father the moment he became a burden and stopped earning much money.*
*There was no love, only craving.*

*I don’t know what the starting point is,but evil at any point leads to more and more evil.*

*Evil begets more evil.*

*Craving leads to greed, Greed to theft,Theft to violence. Violence to death. And death to sorrow.*

*Now,*

*If only he hadn’t craved money so blindly,he might’ve stayed, taken care of the shop and his father.*

*He would have earned anyway, without suffering.*

*He would have lived with his family, lived with self-respect—and most importantly, his father would have lived.*

*So even here there’s no starting point,but good at any point leads to more and more good.*

*Good begets more good.*

*Compassion leads to responsibility, Responsibility to care, Care to a happy family, And a happy family to peace.*

*Ultimately, **EVIL BEGETS EVIL and GOOD BEGETS GOOD***

*This is the eternal truth!”*

Sid closed the journal softly. His eyes were wet, but there was a quietness in his chest now, something still and certain. Looking at the reddish golden hue of Sunset touching the gentle waves of  the River, the lazy strokes of exhausted fisherman rowing boat home, each stroke steady and slow. In that fading light, with the breeze in his hair and the smell of earth around him, Sid felt something close to peace...
