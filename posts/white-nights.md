## Analysis (taken reference from Unsolicited Advice Youtube Channel):
### Danger of Narratives:
1. The protagonist is a lonely person who lives in the Narrartives he creates, he even says that he buries his head in the Literature and Dreams.
2. We all love Narrations and creating a story for ourself, the succeful people romanticie the Narrations by giving a success story of thier lives, in reality their success is all about their practice at right time in a right place, a bit of luck to get those opporunities and some unfair advantage.
3. Even our Protagonist falls for the trap of Narrative, he sees himself as the Hero of a Romance novel, expects an ending that makes him the ultimate saviour of the plot.
4. In fact his reality goes as his narrative till the last moment, when Natesnka almost decided to move on and build a relationship with our Narrator, it is in that moment the man she loved appears and she leaves the narrator for that Man.
5. To readers this is devastating and unfair, as we are programmed to see everything as a Story this ending doesn’t fit our Story; Natenska has to leave that man and shoudl go to the Narrator.
6. But if we zoom out and observe, it’s absolutely sensible for Natenska to leave the Narrator, because she knows Narrator only for few nights and that too she is seeing him for on the purpose related to the person she loved.
7. So it is obvious that she leaves the Narrator, but the reason we got stung like our Narrator when Natenska leaves him is because, we too like our Narrator fallen for the trap of Narrative or a Story.

### Great(but Flase Narratives):
1. Attachment is what wounds us deeply leaves long lasting scars.
2. Here the Narrator is attached to his expectation of Great Story
*“Nastenka is very clear throughout the novel that she deepely values the burgeoining friendship she has with out protagonist but she has no romantic aspirations for the relationship, she even makes him promise that he won’t fall in love with her….But his expectations spirla out of control nonethless.”* - Unsolicited Advice
3. Narrator is too attached to the narratives he creates, even there’s no certainity in the narrative.
*“the problem comes when the romantic person becomes attached to their imagined view of the future and is reluctant to let it go whatever evidence that springs up to the contrary.”* - Unsolicited Advice
4. Epictetus says; even in our deepest relationships we have relaise that our person is not our to control; they may grow sick or sick of us or decide to be with someone else
5. Instead of unrealistic narrative; The Narrator could have forged a beuatiful platonic relaitonship with Nastenska, but he chose Imagination over reality
*“Our narrator could have forged a wonderful platonic connection with Nastenka and their friendship could have been one of the corner stones of their happiness, but he was married to the patticular view of what was going to happen, and as a result he was devastated by what he actually did”*. - Unsolicited Advice.
6. Managing the expectaton would help to stay. grounded with reality.

### The Dangers of Imaginaion:
1. The Narrator like to escape into his imaginary and narrative world, rather than living in the reality.
2. Imagine himself as a Protagonaist of the world and everything surrounds him.
3. He thinks about the day where his imagination doesn’t help him anymore to escape the reality and the day he will be realised he is no special and same like everyone else
*“they fantasise about all the ways, life could go for them, all of the parts they could take until one day the illusion can no longer be maintained and the despair pounces upon all the more potent for having been ignored so long”*  - Joe Folley (Unsolocited advice)
4. But there’s also a subtlety to the aspect of Imagination, whicle it is dangerous that keeps us away from the reality, at the same time it can create altogether a New Reality It is imagination of Authors, Scientists, Philosphers, Leaders etc.. That made the world what it is now.
*“on the one hand story hammers home the message that we should be too careful about dwelling for so long in our imagination but on the other hand the very existence of Doestoevsky’s works is the reminder of the great power of storytelling to communicate thought in rich and meaningful way unmatched by other media.”* - Joe Halley (Unsolocited Advice)
5. Joe Folley takes that Imagination is powerful and it can chnage the reality, but it is no substitute for reality.

### Ego Romance and Suffering:
*“We put ourselves thorugh unhelpful or self-desructive behaviour patterns becaus we are trying to guard some aspect of our own ego.”*  - Joe Halley (Unsolicited Advice)
1. We sometimes know that a situation is not helping anymore infact it is distrubing our mental peace, but still we chose to endure in that situation is just because the Self-Image that is created by that Situation is so hard to leave, we are so attached to that self-image.
2. The Narrator is lonely but is self obsessed with the Narrative he has in his head and lives alone and do not let anyone take the spotlight of his life from him.
3. He became attracted to Nastenska as she is fitting his Narrative, potraying him as a Hero of the story he wanted.
4. When Nastenka abandons him, his Narrative is shatterd such that he says it feels like a Sting in the Heart.
5. At the same time we can see the lonely Natenska also has a Narrative for herself, she wants to be the Person who is loved, when the Lodger did not appear, she immdeately ran into the arms of the Narrator, which says in her Narrative she’s the Queen who is longed to be loved.
6. So, ultimately we need to realise that We are just part of the larger society, where everyone  has their own narratives and everyone are the hero of their own story.
*“If we are constantly concerned with our own self-image then its very easy to live our lives entirely in our heads this can give us a inflated view of our own significance at first this might seem like a good thing but it brings with it a awful lot of pressure it places us under the harsh spotlight of the center of the Universe and the chanced are we would rather be anywhere else. So, I think its important from time to time, to remind ourselves that we are just a tiny part of a network of people all of whom have thoughts and feeling just as significant as our own this may not be narratively satisfying as the habit of imagining ourselves as the protagonist of reality itself but in the long run its likely to make us happier.”*  - Joe Halley (Unsolicited Advice)

### The Over-Focus on Romantic Love:
1. Love is what redeems Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment.
2. But White Nights, gives a nuanced insght into the Cultural obsession on romantic love
3. The Narrator is so obsessed with Romantic such that he assumes himself to be in the same room being lonely dwelling upon the Sweet times of meeting Nastenka
4. Only if he could come out of the obsession with Romantic Love; he could see the various aspects of life that would add same or even a greater meaning to his life (Is this the case through which Love Failures travel through?)

*“Aristotle once said that the greater part of love was in the loving that it is the lover who can get the most the meaning out of love, If only they learn to love in the right way. If the narrator learns to embrace this more selfless and open sort of love perhaps he could have found meaning in his life separate from a romantic partner, perhaps he could have learnt to love the process of lovign rather than pining endlessly after the love of other people”*  - Joe Halley (Unsolicited Advice)

5. Through the meetings with Nastenka he learnt how to love, now he could use that experience to make himelf a better lover instead of dwelling in despair and becoming complacent with the Novel Style Romantic Story.

*“through his meetings with Nastenka he has learnt how to love and now he could give that love to the world in a whole host of different flavours rather than rotting away in his dingy petersberg apartment.”* - Joe Halley (Unsolicited Advice)

## My own take:
After reading the Novel; i felt a sense of abandonment, i took it so personal that it happened to myself, I felt the true love doesn’t get recognition, it is always the romantic version of the partner that was given all attention. I felt the protagonist was betryed and shattered. (But after watching the analysis of Joe Folley (Unsolicited Advice, I came to know i had fallen for the trap of naration) edit (I am bound to fall for the trap of Narration, it is just inevitable)

But isn’t falling into the Trap of Great Narrative inevitable for Lonely, Alienated and Depressed ones to endure with Harsh Reality?
1. The case with lonely people is not that simple, it’s quite complicated.
2. They are made to live their lives, by dejecting life itself.
3. Because of Neglectful Parenting or Alienated Society or Poor Socialistion in the Community; the Lonely people are stripped away from the chance to build the skill of socialisation
4. Despair becomes their new companion, for people seeing them from far away it seems like they aren’t trying enough, but for the people who are in the shoes of the person they realises That they find no point in trying enough.
5. Being in darkness for so long would make them blinded to any hope that lies in front.
6. Alienation eats their courage and confidence.
7. Lack of Socialisation traps them into the comfort of being with themselves.
8. Ultimately the only Solace they could find in their lonely lives is the Great Narrative.
9. So, the redemption of Lonely People is not that easy; i guess only the clear Truth or the Meaning could help them bring out of their suffering and misery.
10. That is what Philosophies like Buddhism and Stoicism are trying for; to make People realise the ultimate truth such that instead of letting the Pain take charge of them, they could atleast detach themselves from Pain and don’t let it be the driving factor of their lives.
11. So, Yes i agree with the Point of Falling into the Trap of Expectations and Great Narratives, but at same time Lonely people are helpless in falling for that Trap, What i Feel is they needed some Meaning or Understanding in form of Philosophy, or best, Therapy to make peace with the Pain.
