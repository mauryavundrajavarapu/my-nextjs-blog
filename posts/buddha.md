## THE FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS

 1. First Noble Truth is "There exists Suffering in Life"

 2. Second Noble Truth is "There exists cause for Suffering and Ignorance, Craving and Antipathy are the cause for Suffering"

 3. Third Noble Truth is "There exists end to Suffering"

 4. Fourth Noble Truth is "There exists a way to end Suffering and the Noble Eight Fold Path (Astangamaraga) is the way to end Suffering"

## Life is Suffering: 
Life itself is conditioned by Suffering, When Joy occurs, attaching to it causes Suffering, when Pain occurs, dwelling on it causes suffering, Suffering can be said to be the essential quality of Life. So i chose to say Life is Suffering, This is ths 1st Noble Truth of Buddha. “There exists Dukkha in Life.”

At the same time Suffering is also the essential precursor to Peace, this Peace occurs only by the removal of Suffering. One might misinterpret that, if there’s no Life then there will be no Suffering and there’s Peace, but according to Buddhism, No Life doesn’t mean there wouldn’t be Rebirth, Rebirth can and will happen till there is Ignorance, Craving and Antipathy. And this is the 2nd Noble Truth of Buddha. “There exists cause for Suffering; Ignorance, Craving and Antipathy are the cause for suffering.”

But Buddha assured that this Suffering can cease. It’s logical right, If Ignorance, Craving and Antipathy are cause for Suffering, then by ceasing these three one can cease Suffering also. This is the 3rd Noble Truth of Buddha. “There exists Cessation of Suffering.”

Buddha didn’t leave it there, he further showed the way to cease Suffering, he found through his personal enlightenment a way to end suffering, this way is nothing but Noble Eight Fold Path. Which is the 4th Noble Truth of Buddha. “There exists a way to cease Suffering and it is the Noble Eight Fold Path.”

## Samsara, Anatta(No-Self) and Nirvana
Buddhism believes there's no-self(Anatta) and Impermanence (Anicca), what we are experiencing as Self is the impermanent manifestation of craving carried through Karmic Tendencies. The ignorance of Suffering gives rise to Craving/Antipathy and causes us to pursue Craving/Antipathy through Karma(Mental or Physcial), If Karma quenches the craving, then it would lead to further cravings, if not quenched then there will be constant suffering.  So, the ultimate cycle is: Ignorance -> Craving/Antipathy -> Karma -> Clinging/Suffering-> Karma -> Suffering/Clinging -> so on… and the Cycle continues.

Note: Karmic Tendencies according to Buddhism means, the habits and conditions shaped by our past Actions(Karma which is either Mental or Physical), they influence how we think, act, and even how we're reborn(as a personality or literal life). Also the Karma shouldn't always have to be physical action, it can also be a mental action.

After the Death, one might assume the Cycle of Karma and Suffering stops, but the Karmic Tendencies created by Past Karma, are conditioned to make Fundamental Aggregates/Khandas(in Buddhism) to have a Rebirth, such that the Birth starts and the cycle starts again. This Cycle is called Samsara. The Karmic Tendencies which are conditioned to cause Births and start the loop, are characterised by Ignorance, Craving, Suffering.

Note: Fundamental Aggregates, for the sake of understanding can be assumed to be similar to Electrons, in presence of Nutrons and Protons they form Atoms, such a way in presence Craving the Fundamental Aggregates form the Being (Could be a State like Ego or literal Life). The Craving is carried by the Karmic Tendencies.

Therefore the only way through which a Life can get redemption from Suffering is through extinguishing Ignorance, Craving and Antipathy. When the Ignorance ceases, one realises the perilous nature of Craving/Antipathy and they will cease this Craving/Antipathy through **Noble Eight Fold Path**. So there will be no further Karmic Tendencies formed through Karma, as no new Karma(to quench craving) would take place through the person. So without Karmic Tendencies, the Fundamental Aggregates wouldn’t have the influence of Craving, as craving itself ceases. Ultimately they(Fundamental Aggregates) don’t actualise to form Life again. So, there will be cessation of Suffering. Thus the Loop of Samsara Stops. There won’t be any further manifestation of Self. Nirvana!!! (Stop Ignorance -> Stop Craving/Antipathy -> No Further Karma -> Cycle Stops)

PS:
Ceasing the Ignorance, Craving and Antipathy might seem confusing, as for Human Life or any Life, craving is an inherent Nature and many times it even lead to progress. But Buddha found a way to progress Life even by ceasing the Cravign. And that way is "The Middle Way of Buddha" which is formulated as "Noble Eight Fold Path". I will make an other post on how "Noble Eight Fold Path" helps us cease Craving and Liberate us from Suffering. I suggest you to do your own research to understand the significance of Noble Eight Fold Path.

Fundamental Elements/Particle/Aggregates, are also known as Khandas according to Buddhism.  These five aggregates (khandhas): form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness are what we mistake for the "self." But none of them are permanent or independently existing.

Also one might confuse Rebirth with Soul transmigration from one body to another. According to Buddhism there is no single aspect of Universe, that can be considered to be permanent or Self. So here the Rebirth is nothing but manifestation of Past Karmic Tendencies which in turn are characterised by Ignorance, Craving and Suffering. (Analogy: Like how a Fire travels from one candle to another candle, while having no permanent Fire)

Also this complete Discussion is designed by me through my Personal Knowledge of Buddhism. I designed it with an intention to make these concepts understandable to the Beginner of Buddhism or any Non - Buddhsit who is interested in these concepts. Though I designed this through my personla knowledge, I have cross checked it with the sources in the Internet and it tallies almost perfectly. But i still suggest you to make your own pursuit for Knowledge.
